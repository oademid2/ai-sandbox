Most work full time, although part-time work is common. \\\\n \\\\n How to Become a Postsecondary Teacher \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Educational requirements vary by subject and the type of educational institution. Typically, postsecondary teachers must have a Ph.D. However, a master\\'s degree may be enough for some postsecondary teachers at community colleges, and others may need work experience in their field of expertise. \\\\n \\\\n Pay \\\\n \\\\n The median annual wage for postsecondary teachers was $83,980 in May 2024. \\\\n \\\\n Job Outlook \\\\n Overall employment of postsecondary teachers is projected to grow 8 percent from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations.\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n About 118,900 openings for postsecondary teachers are projected each year, on average, over the decade.\\\\n \\\\n Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire. \\\\n \\\\n State &amp; Area Data \\\\n Explore resources for employment and wages by state and area for postsecondary teachers. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Similar Occupations \\\\n \\\\n Compare the job duties, education, job growth, and pay of postsecondary teachers with similar occupations. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n More Information, Including Links to O*NET \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Learn more about postsecondary teachers by visiting additional resources, including O*NET, a source on key characteristics of workers and occupations. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n What Postsecondary Teachers Do \\\\n \\\\n About this section \\\\n \\\\n Professors may teach a variety of subjects, such as history, science, or business. \\\\n \\\\n Postsecondary teachers instruct students in a variety of academic subjects beyond the high school level. They may also conduct research and publish scholarly papers and books. \\\\n Duties \\\\n Postsecondary teachers typically do the following: \\\\n \\\\n Develop an instructional plan (known as a course outline or syllabus) for the course(s) they teach and ensure that it meets college and department standards \\\\n Plan lessons and assignments \\\\n Teach courses in their subject area \\\\n Assess students\\\\u2019 progress by grading assignments, papers, exams, and other work \\\\n Advise students about which courses to take and how to achieve their goals \\\\n Work with colleagues to develop or modify the curriculum for a degree or certificate program involving in-person, online, or hybrid delivery of course material \\\\n Stay informed about changes and innovations in their field \\\\n Serve on academic or administrative committees, as needed \\\\n \\\\n Postsecondary teachers, often referred to as professors or faculty , specialize in a variety of subjects and fields. At colleges and universities, professors are organized into departments by degree field, such as history, science, or business. A professor may teach one or more courses within that department. For example, a mathematics professor may teach calculus, statistics, and a graduate seminar on a topic related to polynomials. \\\\n Postsecondary teachers\\\\u2019 duties vary, often based on the size of their employing institution. In large colleges or universities, they may teach courses, conduct research or experiments, publish original research, apply for grants to fund their research, or supervise graduate teaching assistants. In small colleges and universities or in community colleges, they may spend most of their time teaching courses and working with students. \\\\n Full-time professors, particularly those who have tenure (that is, they cannot be fired without just cause), often are expected to devote a great deal of time on original research. Tenured professors must document their analyses or critical reviews and publish their research findings. They also may be expected to serve on college and university committees. \\\\n Part-time professors, often known as adjunct professors , usually spend most of their time teaching students. \\\\n Professors may teach large classes of several hundred students (often with the help of graduate teaching assistants), smaller classes of about 40 to 50 students, seminars with a few students, or laboratories in which students practice the subject matter. Some teach online, either exclusively or in addition to providing live instruction. \\\\n Professors\\\\u2019 tasks also may include collaborating with their colleagues and attending conferences to keep up with developments in their field. \\\\n Information about postsecondary teachers who provide vocational training in subjects such as repair, transportation, and cosmetology is available in the profile on career and technical education teachers . \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Work Environment About this section \\\\n \\\\n Most classes are held during the day, but some are held on nights and weekends. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Postsecondary teachers held about 1.4 million jobs in 2023.

In the U.S., the word \\\\\"professor\\\\\" is often used to refer to anyone who teaches at a college of university level at any academic rank . [ 1 ] This usage differs from the predominant usage of the word professor in other countries, where the unqualified word \\\\\"professor\\\\\" only refers to \\\\\"full professors\\\\\" (i.e., the highest rank among regular faculty), nor is it generally used in the United States for secondary education teachers. Other tenure-track faculty positions include assistant professor (entry level) and associate professor (mid-level). Other teaching-focused positions that use the term \\\\\"professor\\\\\" include Clinical Professor, Professor of Practice, and Teaching Professor (specific roles and status vary widely among institutions, but usually do not involve tenure). Most faculty with titles of \\\\\"Lecturer\\\\\" and \\\\\"Instructor\\\\\" in the U.S. are not eligible for tenure, though they are still often referred to as \\\\\"professors\\\\\" in a general sense and as a courtesy form of address. [ 2 ] Non-tenure-track positions may be full or part time, although the qualifier \\\\\"adjunct\\\\\" always denotes part-time (whether combined with the word \\\\\"professor\\\\\" or not).\\\\n Research and teaching are among the main tasks of tenured and tenure-track professors, with the amount of time spent on research or teaching depending strongly on the type of institution. Publication of articles in conferences, journals, and books is essential to occupational advancement. [ 3 ] In 2011, a survey conducted by TIAA-CREF Institute senior researcher Paul J. Yakoboski estimated that 73% of professors with senior tenure ranged between the ages of 60 and 66 and that the remaining 27% were above the age of 66. [ 4 ] Yakoboski estimated that 75% of these professors have acknowledged that they have made no preparations for retirement due to the ongoing financial crisis and reluctance to leave their profession. [ 4 ] A 2013 survey conducted by Fidelity Investments would echo similar results when the question about retirement came up. [ 5 ] \\\\n In 2020, the National Center for Education Statistics counted 189,692 professors, 162,095 associate professors, 166,543 assistant professors, 96,627 instructors, 44,670 lecturers, and 164,720 other full-time faculty. [ 6 ] \\\\n \\\\n The term \\\\\"professors\\\\\" in the United States refers to a group of educators at the college and university level . In the United States, while \\\\\"Professor\\\\\" as a proper noun (with a capital \\\\\"P\\\\\") generally implies a position title officially bestowed by a university or college to faculty members with a PhD or the highest level terminal degree in a non-academic field (e.g., MFA, MLIS), [ citation needed ] the common noun \\\\\"professor\\\\\" is often used casually to refer to anyone teaching at the college level, regardless of rank or degree. At some junior colleges without a formal ranking system, instructors are accorded the courtesy title of \\\\\"professor\\\\\".\\\\n Although almost all tenured professors hold doctorates, [ citation needed ] some exceptional scholars without them are occasionally granted tenure: Jay Forrester (electrical engineering, M.I.T. ) had only a master\\'s degree; Saul Kripke (philosophy, Rockefeller ) and Andrew Gleason (mathematics, Harvard ) had only a bachelor\\'s degree; Edward Fredkin (computer science, M.I.T. ) and Erik Erikson (psychology, Harvard) did not even have bachelor\\'s degrees. Tenure without a doctorate is somewhat more common in fields with an artistic component, as with Howard Nemerov (poetry, Washington University in St. Louis ) and Colin Rowe (architectural history and theory, Cornell ). Until the middle of the 20th century, professors without doctorates were more common.\\\\n \\\\n Tenured and tenure-track positions [ edit ] \\\\n These full-time faculty members with PhDs or other highest-level terminal degrees (designated as acceptable by a university or college, including the \\\\\"professional equivalent\\\\\" to the doctorate at institutions such as Columbia University [ 7 ] ), engage in both undergraduate and graduate teaching, mentoring, research, and service. Only faculty in these positions are eligible for tenure .\\\\n \\\\n Assistant Professor : An introductory level professor. A position generally taken after receiving a PhD and often, especially in the sciences, completing a post-doctoral fellowship. After 7 years, in most American colleges and universities, a tenure-track faculty member (usually assistant professor) must be either awarded tenure, or dismissed from the university . \\\\n Associate Professor : A mid-level, usually tenured, professor. \\\\n Professor (sometimes referred to as \\\\\"Full Professor\\\\\" ): a senior, tenured professor. \\\\n Distinguished Professor or Endowed Chair (e.g., \\\\\"the Brian S. Smith Professor of Physics\\\\\"): An honorary position in which a full professor\\'s salary may be increased, perhaps by being tied to an endowment derived from the university, private individuals, firms, or foundations. \\\\n The top administrative post in many academic departments is the \\\\\"department chair .\\\\\" Prior to the 1970s, such administrators were called \\\\\"chairmen\\\\\" or \\\\\"chairwomen\\\\\", but the term in most institutions has since been the gender-neutral \\\\\"chairperson\\\\\", or shortened to \\\\\"chair\\\\\". While many department chairs also hold endowed chair positions, the two positions are distinct.\\\\n Educators who hold a formal title of \\\\\"Professor\\\\\" (referred to as tenured/tenure-track faculty) typically begin their careers as assistant professors (or \\\\\"lecturers\\\\\" and \\\\\"senior lecturers\\\\\"), with subsequent promotions to the ranks of associate professor and finally professor . The titles are historical traditions; for example, it is not implied that an assistant professor \\\\\"assists\\\\\" more senior faculty. There is often a strict timeline for application for promotion from assistant to associate professor, most often 5 or 6 years following the initial appointment. Applicants are evaluated based on their contributions to research, teaching, and administration. The relative weightings of these contributions differ by institution, with PhD-granting universities usually placing more emphasis on research and liberal arts colleges placing more emphasis on teaching. The decision to grant tenure and promotion from assistant to associate professor usually requires numerous levels of approval, with a common sequence being:\\\\n \\\\n external reviewers\\\\u2014several nationally or internationally prominent academics in the candidate\\'s field will be asked to review the candidate\\'s application for promotion and submit a confidential report; \\\\n based on this report and evidence of the candidate\\'s accomplishments in his or her curriculum vitae, a committee of members from the candidate\\'s department will make a recommendation for tenure/promotion or denial of such; \\\\n the department will vote; \\\\n the department decision is communicated to a university panel of individuals from outside of the department who evaluate the application and decide whether they agree or disagree with the departmental recommendation; \\\\n the dean; \\\\n the board of governors/president or other upper level governing body. \\\\n A decision to reject a candidate for tenure normally requires that the individual leave the institution within two years (under the AAUP tenure guidelines). Otherwise, tenure is granted along with promotion from assistant to associate professor. Although tenure and promotion are usually separate decisions, they are often highly correlated such that a decision to grant a promotion coincides with a decision in favor of tenure, and vice versa. Promotion to associate professor usually results in an increased administrative load and membership on committees that are restricted to tenured faculty.\\\\n Some people remain at the level of associate professor throughout their careers. However, most will apply for the final promotion to full professor; the timeline for making this application is more flexible than that\", \"DATA_POINT\": 189692, \"DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW\": \"The text explains the various ranks and roles of professors within U.S. higher education institutions, including the distinctions between tenure-track and non-tenure-track positions.

They are typically paid through research contracts and grants, so their numbers concentrate in the medical and STEM fields and vary with available grant funding. \\\\n Other academic appointees include academic researchers; cooperative extension advisors and specialists in cooperative extension; librarians; faculty administrators such as Deans; university extension instructors; graduate students appointed as Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants; and residents, interns, and other trainees in medicine and other academic health sciences programs. \\\\n Diversity \\\\n The University of California is committed to diversity and excellence in its faculty and academic workforce. The proportion of women, African American, and Hispanic/Latinx faculty continues to grow, as newer faculty cohorts are more diverse than past cohorts. \\\\n Among tenured and tenure-track faculty, UC compares favorably in terms of the proportions of women, African American, and Hispanic/Latinx faculty relative to the comparison of eight peer research institutions. 2 Still, UC continues to work to identify opportunities to diversify the faculty and improve recruitment processes and campus climate by tracking recruitment data, by sharing best practices in mentoring and professional development, and by enhancing work-life balance programs. \\\\n Various programs have been put in place to strengthen faculty diversity. Two examples are Advancing Faculty Diversity and the President\\'s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (PPFP) . \\\\n Hiring and retention \\\\n The UC 2030 goals to add 1,100 ladder rank faculty between 2018 and 2022 will take longer to attain. Over the last four years, UC added 304 ladder rank faculty. The pandemic significantly slowed the pace of faculty hiring and increases in faculty retirements. \\\\n In addition, UC has engaged the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education since 2016 to design and administer a Faculty Retention and Exit Survey. A summary of the latest results can be found in this May 2022 Regents Item . \\\\n 1 Security of Employment or the tenure-equivalent of associate and full agronomists and astronomers. 2 The comparison eight institutions are University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University at Buffalo, University of Virginia, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and Yale University. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n As of October 2022, UC had 21,672 FTE faculty, consisting of 50% ladder-rank and equivalent, 39% clinical/in-residence/adjunct, and 11% lecturers. \\\\n 5 .1.1 Faculty FTE total by type \\\\n \\\\n UC employees, full-time equivalent (FTE) dashboard \\\\n \\\\n General campus faculty serve in non-health sciences disciplines (such as arts, humanities, social sciences, biological and physical sciences, engineering, law, business, education, etc.) where the majority of UC student degrees are earned. \\\\n Total general campus faculty FTE has increased by 24 percent (2,291 FTE) in the past decade. Ladder-rank faculty FTE has grown by 1,450, or 18 percent, making up about 76 percent of all faculty FTE. \\\\n While FTE in all faculty categories has grown, the most pronounced increase has been among lecturers, who increased by over 46 percent during this period. At UC, lecturers are not required to engage in research or service responsibilities and therefore focus on teaching. Lecturers help meet the instructional needs of UC\\\\u2019s growing enrollment. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n The non-faculty academic workforce has expanded alongside student and faculty growth in the last decade, increasing by 4,485 FTE, or about 18 percent, over this period. \\\\n 5.1.2 Non-faculty academic workforce FTE \\\\n \\\\n UC employees, full-time equivalent (FTE) dashboard \\\\n \\\\n Student teaching and research assistants hold part-time appointments in conjunction with their graduate studies. \\\\n Changes in the FTE of Postdoctoral scholars and academic researchers are connected to the relative availability of research funding.

Since most of their funding comes from contracts and grants, they are particularly prevalent in fields that receive large amounts of grant funding, such as medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering. \\\\n Campuses with large research programs in these fields consequently have larger postdoctoral populations. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n The diversity of UC\\'s academic workforce differs among the types of employees. \\\\n 5.2.1 Academic workforce race/ethnicity and gender by type \\\\n \\\\n UC workforce diversity dashboard \\\\n \\\\n Positions occupied by students and recent graduates (e.g., teaching assistants, research assistants, postdocs, residents/interns) tend to be more diverse, reflecting increasing diversity in graduate student populations. Ladder-rank faculty diversity has been the slowest to change, due to long tenures and limited availability of candidates in some disciplines. The significant number of international academics reflects a global academic marketplace. UC is exploring ways to improve data quality and reverse the recent trend of growth in the share of the population with unknown race/ethnicity. \\\\n Due to the California Gender Recognition Act (SB-179), UC recently revised self-reporting options for gender identity and sexual orientation. Since that change, around 10 percent of employees no longer provide gender information. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n UC has greater diversity in terms of women and Hispanic/Latinx faculty than most of its peers. \\\\n 5.2.2 Percent of tenure and tenure-track faculty who are women and/or African American or Hispanic/Latinx, UC and comparison institutions, Fall 2021 \\\\n \\\\n Source: IPEDS IPEDS data does not capture race and ethnicity for employees who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents.

The workforce has expanded in the past decade, especially lecturers, to meet growing enrollment needs. UC emphasizes diversity in hiring, with programs in place to support this goal, and faces challenges in recruitment due to the slowed pace of faculty hiring and increased retirements post-pandemic.

There are nearly 6,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. Of those schools, 3,982 are degree-granting postsecondary institutions. Private nonprofit institutions make up the largest percentage of four-year schools. When students first start thinking of college, most don\\\\u2019t know how many options are out there. Many are only aware of their local community colleges, state schools, and the prestigious universities whose names dominate books, TV shows, and movies. In reality, the U.S. is home to thousands of institutions. Over the last five years, the number of colleges and universities has declined by just over 13%. Enrollment has also fallen each year. Still, college continues to be a common pathway for young adults to further their education. Nearly 20 million students enrolled in colleges and universities across the country in fall 2020. Below, you\\\\u2019ll find details on where these universities are based and the various categories they fall under. Breakdown of Colleges in the U.S. Number of Colleges by State The following map depicts the number of colleges in the U.S. by state based on the most recent NCES data. Choose Your State Below California, New York, Texas, and Pennsylvania are among the states with the most colleges and universities. Each state has more than 200 institutions, and California is the only state to have more than 300. Three of these four states \\\\u2014 California, New York, and Texas \\\\u2014 serve over 1 million college students . California and Texas are also home to three of the largest public university systems in the U.S.: the University of California, California State University, and the University of Texas. Alaska, Delaware, and Wyoming are among the states with the fewest colleges and universities. Each state has fewer than 10 institutions and serves fewer than 61,000 students . Number of Colleges by Institution Type Colleges and universities are categorized in a multitude of ways. They can be public or private , nonprofit or for-profit, and four-year or two-year (or less). Public universities are funded by local and state governments, primarily through taxes, whereas private colleges are funded through tuition, private donations, and endowments . Private nonprofit colleges are publicly owned and funded through a combination of tuition fees, government funds, and donations. They\\\\u2019re the most common type of higher education institution in the U.S. Private for-profit colleges are owned by private corporations. Like nonprofit institutions, they are funded by tuition and fees; however, those funds are used in different ways. Most funds taken in by for-profit schools are spent on marketing and recruiting rather than on educational programs. As the data above shows, private four-year universities are the most common type of university in the U.S. This category includes all eight Ivy League institutions and more than a handful of other prestigious schools. The second most common type of institution is the public two-year school, which includes most community and technical colleges. Despite being the most popular types of institutions, the numbers of private four-year colleges and public two-year colleges have fallen steadily over the last five years . The number of private two-year institutions has also shrunk since the 2015-16 academic year by nearly 33%. Conversely, the number of public four-year universities in the U.S. has risen by almost 9%. Alternative Educational Pathways Gain Steam As both college enrollment and the number of postsecondary institutions decline throughout the country, interest in nondegree pathways has grown. Options like coding bootcamps have become popular alternatives for those wishing to further their education and enhance their skills. Still, traditional colleges and universities remain the primary choice for most young adults seeking to advance their education.

This rich array of institutions contributes to the country\\\\u2019s reputation as a global leader in education. But just how many colleges are there in the U.S.? Let\\\\u2019s delve into the numbers and explore the variety of institutions available. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), as of fall 2021, there were approximately 4,811 degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States. These institutions are categorized as follows: 4-year colleges and universities : 4,294 2-year colleges : 517 Specialized institutions : 90 The number of colleges and universities in the United States has seen consistent growth over the past few decades. For instance, in 1980, there were only 3,226 degree-granting postsecondary institutions. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including the rising demand for higher education, expanded access to financial aid, and shifting demographics within the U.S. The majority of these institutions are private. In fall 2021, there were 2,859 private colleges and universities compared to 1,952 public ones. Private institutions, while often more expensive, typically offer smaller class sizes and more personalized resources. States with the Most Colleges and Universities Certain states stand out due to their large number of higher education institutions. California, New York, and Texas top the list: California : 1,034 colleges and universities. New York : 666 colleges and universities. Texas : 637 colleges and universities. These states not only have a high number of institutions but are also home to some of the most prestigious universities in the country, such as Stanford University, Columbia University, and the University of Texas at Austin. Types of Colleges and Universities in the U.S. Among the approximately 4,700 degree-granting institutions: Four-Year Colleges and Universities: Around 2,800 offer undergraduate and graduate degrees. These include public universities, private universities, liberal arts colleges, and specialized institutions. Public universities are generally larger with a broader range of programs, while private universities tend to be smaller and more expensive. Liberal arts colleges focus on a broad-based education with a smaller student body, and specialized institutions, such as art or technical schools, offer targeted programs of study. Two-Year Colleges : Approximately 1,800 are community colleges offering associate degrees and vocational programs. Community colleges are typically more affordable than four-year institutions and are designed to provide students with the skills needed to enter the workforce or transfer to a four-year college. It\\\\u2019s essential to note that these numbers are dynamic; new institutions are established, while others may close, and the definitions of \\\\u201ccollege\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cuniversity\\\\u201d can vary from state to state. Why the Number of Colleges in the U.S. Matters Understanding the number of colleges in the U.S. is important for several reasons: Educational Diversity : The vast number of institutions ensures that there is something for everyone, whether a student is looking for a large public university, a small private college, or a specialized institution. Access to Education : With so many institutions, higher education is more accessible to people across different regions, demographics, and financial backgrounds. Economic Impact : Colleges and universities are significant contributors to the economy, not only through education but also by being major employers and centers for research and development. Conclusion: Finding the Right College for You With thousands of colleges and universities across the United States, students have a wealth of options to choose from. Whether you\\\\u2019re looking for a large public university, a private liberal arts college, or a specialized institution, there\\\\u2019s likely a perfect fit for your educational goals.

The number also is subject to change in a higher education landscape that has experienced numerous recent college closures and mergers.\\\\n\\\\n Education is \\\\\"like any industry in the sense that you\\'ve got activity with firms growing, opening, closing, changing, merging continually,\\\\\" says Guilbert C. Hentschke, dean emeritus at the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education.\\\\n\\\\n Though the U.S. Department of Education tallies nearly 4,000 colleges and universities, U.S. News included just 1,452 schools in the 2021 rankings. To be eligible for inclusion in the Best Colleges rankings, a school must be regionally accredited and offer four-year undergraduate degree programs. Colleges that offer only associate degrees are not ranked, nor are schools with fewer than 200 students.\\\\n\\\\n Read:\\\\n\\\\n College vs. University: What\\'s the Difference?\\\\n\\\\n The Number of Public vs. Private Colleges\\\\n\\\\n Of the 3,982 institutions listed by NCES, there were 1,625 public four-year and two-year colleges; 1,660 private nonprofit four-year and two-year schools; and 697 for-profit schools in fall 2019. The data divides the institutions into subcategories such as four-year colleges and universities and two-year schools, often known as community colleges.\\\\n\\\\n Overall, the number of colleges in the U.S. has been on a steady decline since the 2012-2013 school year, particularly in the for-profit sector.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\\"Colleges are closing because they are struggling financially. Many for-profits closed because their enrollment fell off substantially in large part due to adverse publicity, challenges with their students getting financial aid and challenges that the (federal government) posed,\\\\\" Lucie Lapovsky, principal at Florida-based Lapovsky Consulting, former president of Mercy College in New York and an economist wrote in an email. She references stricter regulations on the for-profit sector as one contributing factor.\\\\n\\\\n What Drives College Closures\\\\n\\\\n While for-profit academic institutions have struggled in recent years with many closing, so too have small liberal arts colleges.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\\"Among the private colleges, those most susceptible to closing are the 800 private colleges with enrollment of (fewer) than 1,000 students. Schools that are small, schools that are almost entirely dependent on student revenues,\\\\\" Lapovsky says, adding that vulnerable institutions are threatened by a lack of adequate nontuition funding streams.\\\\n\\\\n Recent examples of such schools shutting down include Becker College in Massachusetts, which announced that it will close this year due to financial struggles exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.\\\\n\\\\n Similarly, Mills College in California announced plans to wind down operations. Already struggling financially, the women\\'s college cited challenges brought on by COVID-19 as a reason for closing.\\\\n\\\\n Hentschke notes that there are many factors in play when it comes to college closures.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\\"It\\'s a combination of size, market location, market recognition and a brand that can either keep you afloat or conspire against you,\\\\\" Hentschke says. Despite market shifts, he notes the number of schools that close or merge is \\\\\"relatively small in a given year.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n Demographics also play a role. The declining birthrate in the U.S. means colleges compete for fewer undergraduate students.\\\\n\\\\n \\\\\"You look across all institutions and that number is going down, not up,\\\\\" Hentschke says.\\\\n\\\\n Instead of closing, some colleges merge with other institutions.

As a result, each offers programs specific to its purpose and student needs. \\\\n Public colleges and universities \\\\n Public colleges and universities are nonprofit schools and receive a majority of their funding from the federal government. They are often the largest of all institutions, offer a broad range of programs, and can be affordable. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Private colleges and universities \\\\n Nonprofit private schools receive their funding from the federal government, tuition, and donations. Money is reinvested back into the school to provide quality education and improve student outcomes and experiences. They are often smaller and more expensive than public institutions, and may offer a narrower scope of programs. For Profit schools are funded through private endowments and investors, federal grants, and tuition. They operate similar to businesses because a majority of their profits go back to their investors. As a result, these schools often face scrutiny. Some have been called \\\\\" diploma mills \\\\\" because of their nefarious student recruitment tactics and how they have spent their profits. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Number of Public vs. Private Colleges in the U.S.\\\\n \\\\n As of the 2020-21 school year, there were 1,576 public and 2,160 private degree granting colleges and universities in the U.S. \\\\n \\\\n Number of Nonprofit vs. For Profit Colleges in the U.S.\\\\n \\\\n During the same time period, there were 3,154 nonprofit and 582 for profit institutes of higher learning across the country. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Four-year Schools \\\\n Four-year schools include public and private colleges and universities that primarily grant undergraduate and graduate degrees such as master\\'s , doctorates , and PhDs. \\\\n \\\\n There were 2,520 four-year and 1,216 two-year colleges and universities in the U.S. as of the 2020-21 school year. \\\\n \\\\n The Number of Colleges Offering Online Courses and Programs\\\\n \\\\n Out of a total 3,928 postsecondary degree granting institutions offering some level of distance education, there are 422 primarily offering online courses and programs as of Fall 2020.

Once you decide on a career , find out what your earnings potential may be, the return on investment (ROI), your opportunities for career growth, and how it can be achieved. You can also look up job information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) and the Occupational Information Network ( O*NET ). Calculate your budget and how much financial aid you may be eligible to receive. After you figure out what it takes to meet your career goals, look at your financial situation and consider your budget \\\\u2014 this will inform your choice of school and whether you choose public or private and two or four-year. You can also estimate what kind of federal financial aid you may be eligible to receive, and start researching scholarships to potentially help pay for tuition. Consider whether you want to attend school online or on campus. If you work full time, juggle multiple responsibilities, or live far from campus, you may want to consider attending online. Online programs offer convenience because classes are often asynchronous, allowing you to participate throughout the week as your schedule allows. However, if you enjoy campus life, actively engaging with your peers, and the structure of a classroom, you may choose to attend on campus. Think about how quickly you want to graduate. Once you determine what you\\'d like to study, you may want to think about how fast you\\'d like to finish. You may be able to enroll in an accelerated program that can shave up to a couple of years off the time spent in college. Or, you may want to take your time and enjoy breaks between terms by enrolling in a traditional-length degree program. Verify the school you are interested in is accredited. Accreditation ensures a school meets high academic quality standards. Always double-check to make sure your school is accredited by an U.S. Department of Education-approved agency and that your program is accredited if applicable. You can also check accreditation status with the Council for Higher Education Accreditation ( CHEA ). Check graduation and retention rates and student reviews. A school\\'s graduation and retention rates can paint a picture of how well they support students throughout their education and prepare them for careers after graduation \\\\u2014 College Scorecard can verify this information. Reviews give more personal and anecdotal insight into the student experience which may also help you choose a school and program. The type of college you choose depends on several factors, including your educational and career goals, location, how quickly you want to finish, and how much money you have to spend. You can take several steps to ensure you make the right decision. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n FAQs About Colleges in the U.S.\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Which State Is #1 in Higher Education?

[ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ needs update ] \\\\n Strong research funding helped elite American universities dominate global rankings in the early 21st century, making them attractive to international students , professors and researchers. [ 15 ] Higher education in the U.S. is also unique in its investment in highly competitive NCAA sports, particularly in American football and basketball , with large sports stadiums and arenas adorning its campuses and bringing in billions in revenue. [ 16 ] \\\\n \\\\n Colonial era to 19th century [ edit ] \\\\n The Wren Building , built at the College of William &amp; Mary in 1695, is the oldest academic building in the United States. The school held African slaves and their descendants for 170 years. \\\\n Religious denominations established early colleges in order to train white, male ministers. Between 1636 and 1776, nine colleges were chartered in Colonial America; today, these institutions are known as the colonial colleges . According to historian John Thelin , most instructors at these institutions were lowly paid \\'tutors\\'. [ 17 ] As objects of the slavocracy , African slaves and their descendants also served as free labor for more than a century and a half. [ 18 ] \\\\n Besides slavery, violence-backed cession was an aspect of higher education growth. This involved more than 200 indigenous nations, nearly 160 treaties and the appropriation of 11 million acres of land. \\\\n [ 19 ] \\\\n Protestants and Catholics opened hundreds of small denominational colleges in the 19th century. In 1899 they enrolled 46 percent of all US undergraduates. Many closed or merged but in 1905 there were over 500 in operation. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Catholics opened several women\\'s colleges in the early 20th century. Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers. [ 22 ] \\\\n The nation\\'s small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders. Elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed little upward social mobility . By concentrating on ministers and the offspring of wealthy families, elite Eastern colleges such as Harvard , Columbia , and Princeton played a role in the formation of a Northeastern elite. [ 23 ] \\\\n In some areas, public institutions of higher education were slow to take hold. For instance, although there was general support for expanding access to higher education through public institutions, private colleges and universities successfully hindered the establishment of a public university in Boston, Massachusetts until the 1860s. The competition between private and public institutions shaped the development of the mixed public-private character of higher education in the United States. [ 24 ] \\\\n \\\\n Catholic colleges and universities [ edit ] \\\\n The Main Building at the University of Notre Dame , a prominent Catholic university in Notre Dame, Indiana \\\\n The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities was founded in 1899 and continues to facilitate the exchange of information and methods. [ 25 ] Vigorous debate in recent decades has focused on how to balance Catholic and academic roles, with conservatives arguing that bishops should exert more control to guarantee orthodoxy. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] \\\\n \\\\n Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) [ edit ] \\\\n Most Historically Black Colleges and Universities were established in the South after the American Civil War, often with the assistance of religious missionary organizations based in the northern United States. HBCUs established prior to the American Civil War include Cheyney University of Pennsylvania in 1837, University of the District of Columbia then known as Miner School for Colored Girls in 1851 and Lincoln University in 1854. [ 29 ] The second Morrill Act (1890) required that states consider black students equally or found separate land-grant schools for them. [ 30 ] \\\\n Protests for civil rights on campus began in the early 20th century, at Shaw University (1919), Fisk University (1924\\\\u20131925), Howard University (1925) and Hampton Institute (1925, 1927).

(2018, November 29). U.S. Aging Trends Are More Alarming Than We Thought. The Hill ; Soergel, A. (2015, December 24). Pretty Soon, Old People Will Have All the Jobs. U.S. News .\\\\n Dramatic headlines aside, even gradual changes in workforce demographics will affect hiring, budgeting, training, and more. Higher education tenure-track faculty may be uniquely affected by these demographic trends. 2 Non-tenure-track faculty, whether in teaching or research, are not examined in this report. These faculty exhibit quite different characteristics, and their role in higher ed is rapidly changing.\\\\n Faculty require long periods of training but often work beyond typical retirement ages; jobs are stable, and turnover is very low; the pipeline for new hires is fundamentally limited; and competition occurs nationally. As the workforce ages, this may create unique challenges for the management of a faculty workforce. \\\\n This report examines CUPA-HR data to consider how faculty are distributed by age, how age and rank interact in terms of salary, the representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities by age and rank, and variations of age across faculty disciplines. 3 Data were collected as part of CUPA-HR\\\\u2019s Faculty in Higher Education Survey from 2018. Data from for-profit institutions were omitted from all analyses. Demographic analyses omit incumbents that did not have the relevant variable reported (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity).\\\\n \\\\n Current Age Distribution of Faculty \\\\n Higher education tenure-track faculty require advanced training, so they are naturally older than typical U.S. workers \\\\u2014 the median age in the U.S. labor force is 42 years compared to the median tenure-track faculty age of 49. There are also significantly more faculty aged 55 or older compared to the general workforce. Just 23% of all U.S. workers are 55 or older, compared to 37% of faculty. 4 U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018). Labor Force Statistics From the Current Population Survey. Table 18b: Employed Persons by Detailed Industry and Age. \\\\n The distribution of faculty ages is shown in Figure 1. Although the number of faculty begins to drop after age 65, 13% of faculty are 65 or older \\\\u2014 compared to 6% of all U.S. workers. 5 Ibid.\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Figure 1. Tenure-Track Faculty Rank and Age Distribution \\\\n Because it takes time to gain seniority, increases in rank are related to increases in age, as seen in the colored shading of Figure 1. As would be expected, most new assistant professors are in their thirties. Among tenure-track faculty older than 55, nearly two-thirds (65%) hold the rank of full professor, whereas more than one quarter (28%) are associate professors, and a small number (6%) are assistant professors. \\\\n Faculty Salaries by Age and Years in Rank \\\\n The median salary of tenure-track faculty increases steadily with age (Figure 2). Much of the increase can be attributed to the large salary differences between ranks. Full professors have the steepest slope in terms of differences in salary as age increases. Older full professors make much more than do younger full professors. For associate professors, older faculty have slightly higher salaries than do younger faculty. For assistant professors, there is very little difference in salary between older and younger faculty. \\\\n \\\\n Figure 2. Tenure-Track Faculty Pay by Age \\\\n Figure 3 depicts median salary differences by years in rank for each rank. Experience matters for full professors: those with more years in rank earn higher salaries. This is also true for associate professors, but only for those with more than five years in rank. Those associate professors who have not experienced a promotion to full professor can expect incremental increases in salary, although their salary remains proportionately lower than salaries of full professors. One can see from the graph that the median salary of an associate professor with 30 years in that rank ($90,865) is still lower than that of a full professor with less than one year in rank ($97,000). For assistant professors, median salaries increase with each year in rank up to five years (right before the point at which assistant professors generally go up for promotion). However, median salaries decrease with each year in this rank after that point. \\\\n \\\\n Figure 3. Tenure-Track Faculty Pay by Rank and Years in Rank \\\\n The Representation of Women and Racial/Ethnic Minorities by Age and Rank \\\\n The adequate representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities among faculty remains a concern in higher ed, particularly in the more senior academic ranks. 6 Bichsel, J.; Li, J.; Pritchard, A.; &amp; McChesney, J. (2018). Faculty in Higher Education Report: Key Findings, Trends, and Comprehensive Tables for Tenure-Track, Non-Tenure Teaching, and Non-Tenure Research Faculty; Academic Department Heads; and Adjunct Faculty at Four-Year Institutions for the 2017-18 Academic Year (Research Report). CUPA-HR.\\\\n Among all tenure-track faculty, women make up 45% of those aged 55 or younger and just 35% of those older than 55. Figure 4 shows the percentage of female faculty by age and rank. Across ranks, the percentage of women declines steadily with age cohort: over half (52%) of faculty in the youngest age group (25-30 years old) are women, but fewer than one-third (30%) in the oldest group (65-70) are. This overall decline is driven largely by a decline in women among full professors with increases in age. \\\\n \\\\n Figure 4. Representation of Women in Tenure-Track Faculty by Age and Rank \\\\n For all tenure-track faculty, racial/ethnic minorities comprise 26% of those 55 or younger and just 16% of faculty older than 55. Figure 5 shows an overall decline with age in the representation of racial/ethnic minorities. 7 Racial/ethnic minorities include anyone reported with a race/ethnicity status as something other than White. It does not include those classified as resident aliens or those whose race/ethnicity was unknown or unreported.\\\\n This appears to be due primarily to lack of promotion. With each increase in rank, from assistant to full professor, there is a decrease in the percentage of minorities. For example, looking at the median age of 49 for all tenure-track faculty, one sees the percentage of minorities is approximately 30% for assistant professors and approximately 20% for full professors. \\\\n \\\\n Figure 5. Representation of Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Tenure-Track Faculty by Age and Rank \\\\n Age Variations Between Disciplines \\\\n Academic disciplines vary substantially in the percentage of older faculty they employ (Figure 6). 8 Disciplines are defined by two-digit 2010 CIP codes established by IPEDs. Two disciplines are omitted in these analyses due to a low number of reported incumbents: personal and culinary services and science technologies/technicians.\\\\n Across all disciplines, the percentage of faculty 55 or older and the percentage of faculty at the full professor rank is the same (37%). However, these two figures vary greatly by discipline. Communications technologies has the lowest percentage of faculty older than 55 and also few full professors, which makes sense for a relatively young field. The opposite is seen in legal professions and studies which has both a large percentage of older faculty and a large percentage of full professors. \\\\n \\\\n Figure 6. Tenure-Track Faculty Older Than 55 by Discipline \\\\n Conclusions and Next Steps \\\\n Tenure-track faculty have a median age of 49, and many in the baby boomer generation are approaching retirement age. This could lead to increased turnover in the coming decade and increased competition in hiring new Ph.D.s.

Differences in university or department size didn\\'t explain the inequalities in faculty production. \\\\n Researchers studied the educational histories of faculty members who worked at the 386 Ph.D.-granting institutions in the U.S. between 2011 and 2020, representing almost 300,000 people. \\\\n They found that faculty members tend to be employed at universities considered less prestigious than those that trained them. A department is considered prestigious if it produces graduates who are hired by other well-regarded departments, according to the paper. Depending on their field of study, only about 5% to 23% of faculty members worked for a university more prestigious than the one at which they earned their Ph.D. \\\\n While these trends enable colleges to hire teaching staff from highly respected institutions, they also limit the employability of faculty graduating from less prestigious universities.

On Twitter, Chris Marsicano, an educational studies professor at Davidson College, criticized that the paper only covered colleges that confer doctoral degrees, even though many professors work at institutions that don\\\\u2019t award Ph.D.s. \\\\n The exclusion of colleges without Ph.D. programs stemmed from a lack of data availability, according to Hunter Wapman, a computer science graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the paper. \\\\n \\\\\"We would have loved to include non-PhD granting universities in the study, but we unfortunately didn\\'t have data for that cohort of faculty,\\\\\" Wapman said in an email. \\\\\"It would be wonderful if, in the future, we could report findings on that population \\\\u2014 and, ideally, on graduate and undergraduate students, as well. \\\\\" \\\\n The Academic Analytics Research Center provided the data set used.\", \"DATA_POINT\": 777, \"DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW\": \"The study, published in Nature, analyzes the distribution of tenured and tenure-track faculty at U.S. Ph.D.-granting universities, highlighting the concentration of faculty production in prestigious institutions.

But while that\\\\u2019s welcome news, the raise was small\\\\u2014only about a half-percent uptick from fall 2022 to this past fall. \\\\n The tiny pay bump comes after years of COVID-19\\\\u2013era inflation eating away at faculty compensation, including entirely consuming institutions\\\\u2019 significant efforts in 2022 to raise wages. But at the same time, the AAUP found that inflation still outpaced salary increases at more than half of the 870 colleges and universities that reported full-time faculty pay information for the survey. And the news is worse for part-time faculty members, whose per-course-section pay actually declined in the new survey when adjusted for inflation. \\\\n The organization published the study\\\\u2019s preliminary results online Tuesday . It includes data from over 375,000 full-time and 92,000 part-time faculty members. Institutions must admit first-time undergraduate students to be included, so standalone graduate schools are excluded. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Most Popular \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Brendan Cantwell, a professor of higher education at Michigan State University, said he thinks the increase in the average real wage \\\\u201cwill be welcome news for faculty, but it will not fully address the concerns that many faculty have about the eroding purchasing power of their salaries.\\\\u201d He added, \\\\u201cwhat we\\\\u2019re not seeing is a real nationwide recognition of wage stagnation as a problem or a major priority for higher education.\\\\u201d \\\\n The survey shows that full-time faculty members\\\\u2019 average salary among the participating institutions has increased to $112,000. (With some exceptions, it includes data for nonmedical instructional faculty members.) In inflation-adjusted dollars, however, that\\\\u2019s still far below the $120,000 average in fall 2019, before the pandemic hit. And all categories of full-time faculty members, save for full professors (who now average over $155,000), make less than the average, so it\\\\u2019s not a good representation of faculty pay overall. \\\\n Another factor beyond full professors\\\\u2019 pay may also inflate the average salary. Glenn Colby, AAUP\\\\u2019s senior researcher, said the survey is \\\\u201cheavily biased\\\\u201d toward master\\\\u2019s and doctoral degree-granting institutions. \\\\u201cWe have very low participation among community colleges and small liberal arts schools, which is not through lack of effort on our part,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\n The survey doesn\\\\u2019t provide explanations from colleges on why real wages are increasing so slowly. While persistent inflation is certainly a factor, colleges are also in an economic bind, said John Cheslock, an education policies studies professor at Pennsylvania State University. \\\\n \\\\u201cBecause universities are often reliant upon their students for revenue, they\\\\u2019re in a catch-22 when it comes to faculty salaries,\\\\u201d Cheslock said. \\\\u201cThey want to increase the salaries for their faculty, but they need to generate the revenue to pay for that. But generating more revenue from students makes it more challenging for them to reach other goals, such as affordability.\\\\u201d \\\\n But as Cantwell noted, \\\\u201cthere\\\\u2019s not a lot of appetite to increase tuition,\\\\u201d which is now the biggest source of income even for most public institutions. Getting faculty members back to their pre-pandemic purchasing power, he said, will require either new revenue or prioritizing salaries over other institutional expenses. \\\\n Then there\\\\u2019s part-time faculty members\\\\u2019 plight. Colby said only 221 institutions reported the pay per standard course section for \\\\u201cadjunct\\\\u201d part-time faculty members for both this year\\\\u2019s survey and last year\\\\u2019s, and the part-time data is from all of last academic year instead of this past fall. After taking those caveats into account, part-timers only averaged $3,900 for each standard course section they taught last academic year. \\\\n That\\\\u2019s the same amount they made in the last annual report\\\\u2014and a 5.6 percent pay cut when you factor in inflation, Colby said. \\\\u201cThe pay has been stuck at about $3,900 for several years among the institutions that provide the data,\\\\u201d he said. He called those wages \\\\u201cappalling,\\\\u201d and noted that most faculty members who are paid per course section don\\\\u2019t receive retirement or medical coverage contributions from their institutions. Overall, part-timers represented nearly half of all U.S. faculty members as of 2021, the AAUP previously reported. \\\\n Disparities by Rank, Sex and Institution Type \\\\n Columbia University\\\\u2019s $308,000 average salary for full-time, full professors ranks it the highest among all participating institutions, Colby said. Among public universities, the University of California, Los Angeles\\\\u2019s $266,000 average salary for full professors ranks it the highest among public doctoral universities that participated. But those are far cries from what most faculty members are paid. \\\\n The average full-time full professor now makes $155,000\\\\u2014still down from the $168,000 in real wages they made back in 2019. A salary chasm persists between the sexes: male full professors make $163,000, while their female peers make $142,000. The AAUP\\\\u2019s data isn\\\\u2019t broken down by race. \\\\n The average assistant professor, who is generally someone on the tenure track but hasn\\\\u2019t yet earned tenure, now makes $92,000. But for men, it\\\\u2019s $96,000, and for women, it\\\\u2019s $89,000\\\\u2014a narrower, but still significant, pay disparity. \\\\n Then there are the instructor and lecturer ranks. Full-time lecturers average $76,000 now, with men averaging $79,000 and women, $73,000. Instructors now average $69,000, with men getting $72,000 and women getting $67,000. \\\\n Disparities also remain wide among public institutions, religious institutions and private, nonprofit, non-religiously affiliated institutions. For example, the average salary for full professors is now $196,000 at the former institutions, compared to $145,000 at public institutions and $137,000 at religious institutions. \\\\n Barrett Taylor, a professor in the higher education program at the University of North Texas, spoke to another disparate impact of wage stagnation, one not easily seen in the data: the vastly different cost-of-living pressures depending on geographic area. \\\\u201cReal earnings have fallen quite a bit since the pandemic and you know that\\\\u2019s going to have asymmetric consequences for people,\\\\u201d Taylor said. \\\\n What can be done to increase wages amid a financial crunch for so many universities? Cantwell noted that \\\\u201cwages are more consistent in unionized campuses.\\\\u201d But he\\\\u2019s not sure the public or policymakers care much about faculty wage stagnation when their priorities lean more toward student costs and outcomes. Meanwhile, he said, \\\\u201chaving a concerted effort to improve faulty working conditions is not something that state legislators are asking institutions to do\\\\u201d\\\\u2014nor is it something families are asking institutions about when they\\\\u2019re considering where to send their children.\", \"DATA_POINT\": 431, \"DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW\": \"The average salary for full-time faculty members in U.S. colleges has slightly increased by about 0.5% after adjusting for inflation, despite a generally stagnant wage environment exacerbated by COVID-19-related inflation.

Notably, pay disparities exist by rank and gender, with male faculty generally earning more than female counterparts. Part-time faculty have seen a decline in inflation-adjusted pay. The survey primarily represents master\\'s and doctoral institutions, with notable underrepresentation from community colleges and liberal arts schools.

But what does it even mean? \\\\n Simply put, an institution\\\\u2019s student to faculty ratio (or student-faculty ratio) is the number of students there are for every one professor at a given institution. It is calculated by dividing a school\\\\u2019s number of enrolled students by its number of teachers. For example, a school with 5,000 students and 500 professors has 10 students for every professor (i.e. a 10:1 ratio). \\\\n For reference, the National Center for Education Statistics found that the national average for college student-to-faculty ratios is 18:1. \\\\n How Important Is This Number to My College Search? \\\\n It is often said that a small student-faculty ratio is best, and understandably: when there are fewer students per professor, classes can be smaller, and every student is more likely to benefit from personalized attention. \\\\n All said, a school with a larger ratio does not always guarantee that students get lost in a sea of thousands of students. Colleges with larger populations do have more students per professor, but they can\\\\u2014and often do\\\\u2014make up for it with more robust resources on campus. A low student-faculty ratio has become synonymous with better, more personalized pedagogy, but that doesn\\\\u2019t mean it\\\\u2019s impossible to get the same from a larger university, just a bit less likely. Ultimately, it\\\\u2019s up to you to decide how important this number is to you. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n Rank School Location Student to Faculty Ratio Acceptance Rate Net Price SAT Range \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA 3% 5% $21,519 1510-1580 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 2 California Institute of Technology Pasadena, CA 3% 3% $23,397 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 3 The Juilliard School New York, NY 4% 9% $42,468 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 4 Princeton University Princeton, NJ 5% 4% $19,811 1500-1580 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 5 University of Chicago Chicago, IL 5% 5% $27,979 1510-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 6 Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 5% 11% $32,964 1500-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 7 The New England Conservatory of Music Boston, MA 5% 43% $49,544 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 8 Williams College Williamstown, MA 6% 10% $16,988 1470-1560 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 9 Yale University New Haven, CT 6% 5% $26,044 1500-1580 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 10 Northwestern University Evanston, IL 6% 7% $23,341 1490-1560 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 11 Duke University Durham, NC 6% 7% $23,422 1510-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 12 Brown University Providence, RI 6% 5% $26,608 1500-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 13 Rice University Houston, TX 6% 8% $20,587 1500-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 14 Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 6% 8% $22,844 1530-1580 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 15 Columbia University in the City of New York New York, NY 6% 4% $20,869 1490-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 16 Stanford University Stanford, CA 6% 4% $17,998 1510-1580 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 17 University of North Carolina School of the Arts Winston Salem, NC 6% 33% $11,163 1150-1350 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 18 Manhattan School of Music New York, NY 6% 40% $51,879 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 19 American Musical and Dramatic Academy New York, NY 6% 25% $46,130 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 20 Cornish College of the Arts Seattle, WA 6% 70% $40,164 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 21 Gallaudet University Washington, DC 6% 61% $15,025 750-933 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 22 University of Holy Cross New Orleans, LA 6% 99% $14,476 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 23 Harvard University Cambridge, MA 7% 3% $17,900 1500-1580 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 24 Dartmouth College Hanover, NH 7% 6% $17,322 1500-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 25 Washington University in St Louis Saint Louis, MO 7% 12% $22,440 1500-1570 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 26 Pomona College Claremont, CA 7% 7% $17,423 1480-1560 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 27 Amherst College Amherst, MA 7% 10% $17,965 1360-1550 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 28 Vanderbilt University Nashville, TN 7% 6% $26,689 1510-1560 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 29 Wesleyan University Middletown, CT 7% 17% $20,463 1450-1540 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 30 Wellesley College Wellesley, MA 7% 14% $21,501 1440-1550 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 31 University of Richmond University of Richmond, VA 7% 23% $35,263 1410-1530 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 32 Yeshiva University New York, NY 7% 64% $38,118 1320-1500 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 33 Lawrence University Appleton, WI 7% 63% $27,393 1200-1430 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 34 University of the Arts Philadelphia, PA 7% 78% $44,510 Test Blind \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n 35 Earlham College Richmond, IN 7% 74% $26,517 1178-1363 Test Optional \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n More Amazing Colleges &gt;&gt;&gt; \\\\n You may notice something about our 10 Best Student-Faculty Ratio Colleges; many accept less than 10% of the students that apply.

To meet rising demand, the number of faculty increased nationwide by just over 55 percent, from 515,684 to 800,611, between the 1993-1994 and 2013-2014 school years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the college faculty profession has one of the fastest growth rates in the nation and will see a 19 percent increase in jobs between 2012 and 2022. [1] [2] [3] \\\\n A growing portion of these jobs are part-time or adjunct faculty and teaching and research assistants, as opposed to full-time tenured faculty members. By the mid-1990s, part-time faculty comprised over half of total instructional faculty, a figure which continued to increase before leveling off in 2013. As of the 2013-2014 school year, part-time faculty at public four-year institutions, including teaching and research assistants, comprised 55.1 percent of the total number of faculty nationwide, up from 48.5 percent 20 years earlier. This figure was even higher at public two-year institutions: 69 percent. The BLS expects this trend to continue into the future. [1] [4] \\\\n Additionally, just like the college student population, the demographics of college faculty are shifting, with the most dramatic shift occurring in the numbers of male and female faculty. By the 2013-2014 school year, the percentages of female, black and Hispanic faculty members had reached their highest levels ever: 42.3 percent, 5.4 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively.

The number of part-time faculty, including teaching and research assistants, outnumbered full-time faculty in all but 11 states. The number of teaching and research assistants alone outnumbered full-time faculty in five states. According to the Southern Regional Education Board : [1] \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\u201c\\\\n \\\\n The fact that part-time faculty and teaching/research assistants are a majority of the instructional staff does not mean they do a majority of the instruction, because part-time faculty members and teaching/research assistants typically do not teach as many classes as full-time faculty members.

Meanwhile, 33 percent of nonprofessor-rank faculty were White males and 5 percent were Asian males.

Most work full time, although part-time work is common. \\n \\n How to Become a Postsecondary Teacher \\n \\n \\n Educational requirements vary by subject and the type of educational institution. Typically, postsecondary teachers must have a Ph.D. However, a master's degree may be enough for some postsecondary teachers at community colleges, and others may need work experience in their field of expertise. \\n \\n Pay \\n \\n The median annual wage for postsecondary teachers was $83,980 in May 2024. \\n \\n Job Outlook \\n Overall employment of postsecondary teachers is projected to grow 8 percent from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations.\\n \\n \\n \\n About 118,900 openings for postsecondary teachers are projected each year, on average, over the decade.\\n \\n Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire. \\n \\n State &amp; Area Data \\n Explore resources for employment and wages by state and area for postsecondary teachers. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Similar Occupations \\n \\n Compare the job duties, education, job growth, and pay of postsecondary teachers with similar occupations. \\n \\n \\n More Information, Including Links to O*NET \\n \\n \\n Learn more about postsecondary teachers by visiting additional resources, including O*NET, a source on key characteristics of workers and occupations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n What Postsecondary Teachers Do \\n \\n About this section \\n \\n Professors may teach a variety of subjects, such as history, science, or business. \\n \\n Postsecondary teachers instruct students in a variety of academic subjects beyond the high school level. They may also conduct research and publish scholarly papers and books. \\n Duties \\n Postsecondary teachers typically do the following: \\n \\n Develop an instructional plan (known as a course outline or syllabus) for the course(s) they teach and ensure that it meets college and department standards \\n Plan lessons and assignments \\n Teach courses in their subject area \\n Assess students’ progress by grading assignments, papers, exams, and other work \\n Advise students about which courses to take and how to achieve their goals \\n Work with colleagues to develop or modify the curriculum for a degree or certificate program involving in-person, online, or hybrid delivery of course material \\n Stay informed about changes and innovations in their field \\n Serve on academic or administrative committees, as needed \\n \\n Postsecondary teachers, often referred to as professors or faculty , specialize in a variety of subjects and fields. At colleges and universities, professors are organized into departments by degree field, such as history, science, or business. A professor may teach one or more courses within that department. For example, a mathematics professor may teach calculus, statistics, and a graduate seminar on a topic related to polynomials. \\n Postsecondary teachers’ duties vary, often based on the size of their employing institution. In large colleges or universities, they may teach courses, conduct research or experiments, publish original research, apply for grants to fund their research, or supervise graduate teaching assistants. In small colleges and universities or in community colleges, they may spend most of their time teaching courses and working with students. \\n Full-time professors, particularly those who have tenure (that is, they cannot be fired without just cause), often are expected to devote a great deal of time on original research. Tenured professors must document their analyses or critical reviews and publish their research findings. They also may be expected to serve on college and university committees. \\n Part-time professors, often known as adjunct professors , usually spend most of their time teaching students. \\n Professors may teach large classes of several hundred students (often with the help of graduate teaching assistants), smaller classes of about 40 to 50 students, seminars with a few students, or laboratories in which students practice the subject matter. Some teach online, either exclusively or in addition to providing live instruction. \\n Professors’ tasks also may include collaborating with their colleagues and attending conferences to keep up with developments in their field. \\n Information about postsecondary teachers who provide vocational training in subjects such as repair, transportation, and cosmetology is available in the profile on career and technical education teachers . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Work Environment About this section \\n \\n Most classes are held during the day, but some are held on nights and weekends. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Postsecondary teachers held about 1.4 million jobs in 2023.

       "    'DATA_SOURCE_TEXT': 'Professors in the United States commonly occupy any of several positions of teaching and research within a college or university . In the U.S., the word \"professor\" is often used to refer to anyone who teaches at a college of university level at any academic rank . [ 1 ] This usage differs from the predominant usage of the word professor in other countries, where the unqualified word \"professor\" only refers to \"full professors\" (i.e., the highest rank among regular faculty), nor is it generally used in the United States for secondary education teachers. Other tenure-track faculty positions include assistant professor (entry level) and associate professor (mid-level). Other teaching-focused positions that use the term \"professor\" include Clinical Professor, Professor of Practice, and Teaching Professor (specific roles and status vary widely among institutions, but usually do not involve tenure). Most faculty with titles of \"Lecturer\" and \"Instructor\" in the U.S. are not eligible for tenure, though they are still often referred to as \"professors\" in a general sense and as a courtesy form of address. [ 2 ] Non-tenure-track positions may be full or part time, although the qualifier \"adjunct\" always denotes part-time (whether combined with the word \"professor\" or not).\\n Research and teaching are among the main tasks of tenured and tenure-track professors, with the amount of time spent on research or teaching depending strongly on the type of institution. Publication of articles in conferences, journals, and books is essential to occupational advancement. [ 3 ] In 2011, a survey conducted by TIAA-CREF Institute senior researcher Paul J. Yakoboski estimated that 73% of professors with senior tenure ranged between the ages of 60 and 66 and that the remaining 27% were above the age of 66. [ 4 ] Yakoboski estimated that 75% of these professors have acknowledged that they have made no preparations for retirement due to the ongoing financial crisis and reluctance to leave their profession. [ 4 ] A 2013 survey conducted by Fidelity Investments would echo similar results when the question about retirement came up. [ 5 ] \\n In 2020, the National Center for Education Statistics counted 189,692 professors, 162,095 associate professors, 166,543 assistant professors, 96,627 instructors, 44,670 lecturers, and 164,720 other full-time faculty. [ 6 ] \\n \\n The term \"professors\" in the United States refers to a group of educators at the college and university level . In the United States, while \"Professor\" as a proper noun (with a capital \"P\") generally implies a position title officially bestowed by a university or college to faculty members with a PhD or the highest level terminal degree in a non-academic field (e.g., MFA, MLIS), [ citation needed ] the common noun \"professor\" is often used casually to refer to anyone teaching at the college level, regardless of rank or degree. At some junior colleges without a formal ranking system, instructors are accorded the courtesy title of \"professor\".\\n Although almost all tenured professors hold doctorates, [ citation needed ] some exceptional scholars without them are occasionally granted tenure: Jay Forrester (electrical engineering, M.I.T. ) had only a master\\'s degree; Saul Kripke (philosophy, Rockefeller ) and Andrew Gleason (mathematics, Harvard ) had only a bachelor\\'s degree; Edward Fredkin (computer science, M.I.T. ) and Erik Erikson (psychology, Harvard) did not even have bachelor\\'s degrees. Tenure without a doctorate is somewhat more common in fields with an artistic component, as with Howard Nemerov (poetry, Washington University in St. Louis ) and Colin Rowe (architectural history and theory, Cornell ). Until the middle of the 20th century, professors without doctorates were more common.\\n \\n Tenured and tenure-track positions [ edit ] \\n These full-time faculty members with PhDs or other highest-level terminal degrees (designated as acceptable by a university or college, including the \"professional equivalent\" to the doctorate at institutions such as Columbia University [ 7 ] ), engage in both undergraduate and graduate teaching, mentoring, research, and service. Only faculty in these positions are eligible for tenure .\\n \\n Assistant Professor : An introductory level professor. A position generally taken after receiving a PhD and often, especially in the sciences, completing a post-doctoral fellowship. After 7 years, in most American colleges and universities, a tenure-track faculty member (usually assistant professor) must be either awarded tenure, or dismissed from the university . \\n Associate Professor : A mid-level, usually tenured, professor. \\n Professor (sometimes referred to as \"Full Professor\" ): a senior, tenured professor. \\n Distinguished Professor or Endowed Chair (e.g., \"the Brian S. Smith Professor of Physics\"): An honorary position in which a full professor\\'s salary may be increased, perhaps by being tied to an endowment derived from the university, private individuals, firms, or foundations. \\n The top administrative post in many academic departments is the \"department chair .\" Prior to the 1970s, such administrators were called \"chairmen\" or \"chairwomen\", but the term in most institutions has since been the gender-neutral \"chairperson\", or shortened to \"chair\". While many department chairs also hold endowed chair positions, the two positions are distinct.\\n Educators who hold a formal title of \"Professor\" (referred to as tenured/tenure-track faculty) typically begin their careers as assistant professors (or \"lecturers\" and \"senior lecturers\"), with subsequent promotions to the ranks of associate professor and finally professor . The titles are historical traditions; for example, it is not implied that an assistant professor \"assists\" more senior faculty. There is often a strict timeline for application for promotion from assistant to associate professor, most often 5 or 6 years following the initial appointment. Applicants are evaluated based on their contributions to research, teaching, and administration. The relative weightings of these contributions differ by institution, with PhD-granting universities usually placing more emphasis on research and liberal arts colleges placing more emphasis on teaching. The decision to grant tenure and promotion from assistant to associate professor usually requires numerous levels of approval, with a common sequence being:\\n \\n external reviewers—several nationally or internationally prominent academics in the candidate\\'s field will be asked to review the candidate\\'s application for promotion and submit a confidential report; \\n based on this report and evidence of the candidate\\'s accomplishments in his or her curriculum vitae, a committee of members from the candidate\\'s department will make a recommendation for tenure/promotion or denial of such; \\n the department will vote; \\n the department decision is communicated to a university panel of individuals from outside of the department who evaluate the application and decide whether they agree or disagree with the departmental recommendation; \\n the dean; \\n the board of governors/president or other upper level governing body. \\n A decision to reject a candidate for tenure normally requires that the individual leave the institution within two years (under the AAUP tenure guidelines). Otherwise, tenure is granted along with promotion from assistant to associate professor. Although tenure and promotion are usually separate decisions, they are often highly correlated such that a decision to grant a promotion coincides with a decision in favor of tenure, and vice versa. Promotion to associate professor usually results in an increased administrative load and membership on committees that are restricted to tenured faculty.\\n Some people remain at the level of associate professor throughout their careers. However, most will apply for the final promotion to full professor; the timeline for making this application is more flexible than that',\n",

They provide top-quality education to students, develop groundbreaking research, and serve California\\'s diverse communities. \\n Describing the academic workforce \\n Ladder-rank and equivalent faculty are the core of the faculty in advancing the UC\\'s tripartite mission of teaching, research, and public service. These faculty can advance to tenure or equivalent status. 1 \\n In-Residence, Professor of Clinical (e.g., Medicine), Health Sciences Clinical Professor, and Adjunct Professor series faculty are found at all campus locations. However, their numbers are concentrated in the health sciences schools; their duties vary in their focus on research, clinical care, and teaching. Lecturers are focused on instruction and are hired into part-time and full-time positions. Lecturers can achieve continuing status. \\n Postdoctoral scholars conduct research under the general oversight of a faculty mentor. They are typically paid through research contracts and grants, so their numbers concentrate in the medical and STEM fields and vary with available grant funding. \\n Other academic appointees include academic researchers; cooperative extension advisors and specialists in cooperative extension; librarians; faculty administrators such as Deans; university extension instructors; graduate students appointed as Teaching Assistants and Research Assistants; and residents, interns, and other trainees in medicine and other academic health sciences programs. \\n Diversity \\n The University of California is committed to diversity and excellence in its faculty and academic workforce. The proportion of women, African American, and Hispanic/Latinx faculty continues to grow, as newer faculty cohorts are more diverse than past cohorts. \\n Among tenured and tenure-track faculty, UC compares favorably in terms of the proportions of women, African American, and Hispanic/Latinx faculty relative to the comparison of eight peer research institutions. 2 Still, UC continues to work to identify opportunities to diversify the faculty and improve recruitment processes and campus climate by tracking recruitment data, by sharing best practices in mentoring and professional development, and by enhancing work-life balance programs. \\n Various programs have been put in place to strengthen faculty diversity. Two examples are Advancing Faculty Diversity and the President\\'s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (PPFP) . \\n Hiring and retention \\n The UC 2030 goals to add 1,100 ladder rank faculty between 2018 and 2022 will take longer to attain. Over the last four years, UC added 304 ladder rank faculty. The pandemic significantly slowed the pace of faculty hiring and increases in faculty retirements. \\n In addition, UC has engaged the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education since 2016 to design and administer a Faculty Retention and Exit Survey. A summary of the latest results can be found in this May 2022 Regents Item . \\n 1 Security of Employment or the tenure-equivalent of associate and full agronomists and astronomers. 2 The comparison eight institutions are University of Illinois, University of Michigan, University at Buffalo, University of Virginia, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and Yale University. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n As of October 2022, UC had 21,672 FTE faculty, consisting of 50% ladder-rank and equivalent, 39% clinical/in-residence/adjunct, and 11% lecturers. \\n 5 .1.1 Faculty FTE total by type \\n \\n UC employees, full-time equivalent (FTE) dashboard \\n \\n General campus faculty serve in non-health sciences disciplines (such as arts, humanities, social sciences, biological and physical sciences, engineering, law, business, education, etc.) where the majority of UC student degrees are earned. \\n Total general campus faculty FTE has increased by 24 percent (2,291 FTE) in the past decade. Ladder-rank faculty FTE has grown by 1,450, or 18 percent, making up about 76 percent of all faculty FTE. \\n While FTE in all faculty categories has grown, the most pronounced increase has been among lecturers, who increased by over 46 percent during this period. At UC, lecturers are not required to engage in research or service responsibilities and therefore focus on teaching. Lecturers help meet the instructional needs of UC’s growing enrollment. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The non-faculty academic workforce has expanded alongside student and faculty growth in the last decade, increasing by 4,485 FTE, or about 18 percent, over this period. \\n 5.1.2 Non-faculty academic workforce FTE \\n \\n UC employees, full-time equivalent (FTE) dashboard \\n \\n Student teaching and research assistants hold part-time appointments in conjunction with their graduate studies. \\n Changes in the FTE of Postdoctoral scholars and academic researchers are connected to the relative availability of research funding. Contracts and grants from external sponsors support the vast majority of researchers in the academic workforce, with the federal government providing most research funding. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Postdoctoral scholars are concentrated in medicine, science, and engineering, as well as at campuses with larger research programs in those fields. \\n 5.1.3 Postdoctoral scholar headcount, by campus and discipline, November 2022 \\n \\n \\n Source: UC Path \\n Postdoctoral scholars have completed their doctoral degrees and conduct research under the direction and supervision of faculty mentors in preparation for academic or research careers. Since most of their funding comes from contracts and grants, they are particularly prevalent in fields that receive large amounts of grant funding, such as medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering. \\n Campuses with large research programs in these fields consequently have larger postdoctoral populations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n The diversity of UC\\'s academic workforce differs among the types of employees. \\n 5.2.1 Academic workforce race/ethnicity and gender by type \\n \\n UC workforce diversity dashboard \\n \\n Positions occupied by students and recent graduates (e.g., teaching assistants, research assistants, postdocs, residents/interns) tend to be more diverse, reflecting increasing diversity in graduate student populations. Ladder-rank faculty diversity has been the slowest to change, due to long tenures and limited availability of candidates in some disciplines. The significant number of international academics reflects a global academic marketplace. UC is exploring ways to improve data quality and reverse the recent trend of growth in the share of the population with unknown race/ethnicity. \\n Due to the California Gender Recognition Act (SB-179), UC recently revised self-reporting options for gender identity and sexual orientation. Since that change, around 10 percent of employees no longer provide gender information. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n UC has greater diversity in terms of women and Hispanic/Latinx faculty than most of its peers. \\n 5.2.2 Percent of tenure and tenure-track faculty who are women and/or African American or Hispanic/Latinx, UC and comparison institutions, Fall 2021 \\n \\n Source: IPEDS IPEDS data does not capture race and ethnicity for employees who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Therefore, the UC data shown here may differ from other analyses of faculty demographics. \\n Relative to the \"Comparison 8\" universities (four public institutions: Illinois, Michigan, University at Buffalo, Virginia; four private institutions: Harvard, MIT, Stanford, Yale), most UC campuses have a greater share of faculty who are women.

There are nearly 6,000 colleges and universities in the U.S. Of those schools, 3,982 are degree-granting postsecondary institutions. Private nonprofit institutions make up the largest percentage of four-year schools. When students first start thinking of college, most don’t know how many options are out there. Many are only aware of their local community colleges, state schools, and the prestigious universities whose names dominate books, TV shows, and movies. In reality, the U.S. is home to thousands of institutions. Over the last five years, the number of colleges and universities has declined by just over 13%. Enrollment has also fallen each year. Still, college continues to be a common pathway for young adults to further their education. Nearly 20 million students enrolled in colleges and universities across the country in fall 2020. Below, you’ll find details on where these universities are based and the various categories they fall under. Breakdown of Colleges in the U.S. Number of Colleges by State The following map depicts the number of colleges in the U.S. by state based on the most recent NCES data. Choose Your State Below California, New York, Texas, and Pennsylvania are among the states with the most colleges and universities. Each state has more than 200 institutions, and California is the only state to have more than 300. Three of these four states — California, New York, and Texas — serve over 1 million college students . California and Texas are also home to three of the largest public university systems in the U.S.: the University of California, California State University, and the University of Texas. Alaska, Delaware, and Wyoming are among the states with the fewest colleges and universities. Each state has fewer than 10 institutions and serves fewer than 61,000 students . Number of Colleges by Institution Type Colleges and universities are categorized in a multitude of ways. They can be public or private , nonprofit or for-profit, and four-year or two-year (or less). Public universities are funded by local and state governments, primarily through taxes, whereas private colleges are funded through tuition, private donations, and endowments . Private nonprofit colleges are publicly owned and funded through a combination of tuition fees, government funds, and donations. They’re the most common type of higher education institution in the U.S. Private for-profit colleges are owned by private corporations. Like nonprofit institutions, they are funded by tuition and fees; however, those funds are used in different ways. Most funds taken in by for-profit schools are spent on marketing and recruiting rather than on educational programs. As the data above shows, private four-year universities are the most common type of university in the U.S. This category includes all eight Ivy League institutions and more than a handful of other prestigious schools. The second most common type of institution is the public two-year school, which includes most community and technical colleges. Despite being the most popular types of institutions, the numbers of private four-year colleges and public two-year colleges have fallen steadily over the last five years . The number of private two-year institutions has also shrunk since the 2015-16 academic year by nearly 33%. Conversely, the number of public four-year universities in the U.S. has risen by almost 9%. Alternative Educational Pathways Gain Steam As both college enrollment and the number of postsecondary institutions decline throughout the country, interest in nondegree pathways has grown. Options like coding bootcamps have become popular alternatives for those wishing to further their education and enhance their skills. Still, traditional colleges and universities remain the primary choice for most young adults seeking to advance their education.

       "    'DATA_SOURCE_TEXT': 'The United States boasts a vast and diverse higher education landscape, home to thousands of colleges and universities. This rich array of institutions contributes to the country’s reputation as a global leader in education. But just how many colleges are there in the U.S.? Let’s delve into the numbers and explore the variety of institutions available. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), as of fall 2021, there were approximately 4,811 degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the United States. These institutions are categorized as follows: 4-year colleges and universities : 4,294 2-year colleges : 517 Specialized institutions : 90 The number of colleges and universities in the United States has seen consistent growth over the past few decades. For instance, in 1980, there were only 3,226 degree-granting postsecondary institutions. This increase can be attributed to several factors, including the rising demand for higher education, expanded access to financial aid, and shifting demographics within the U.S. The majority of these institutions are private. In fall 2021, there were 2,859 private colleges and universities compared to 1,952 public ones. Private institutions, while often more expensive, typically offer smaller class sizes and more personalized resources. States with the Most Colleges and Universities Certain states stand out due to their large number of higher education institutions. California, New York, and Texas top the list: California : 1,034 colleges and universities. New York : 666 colleges and universities. Texas : 637 colleges and universities. These states not only have a high number of institutions but are also home to some of the most prestigious universities in the country, such as Stanford University, Columbia University, and the University of Texas at Austin. Types of Colleges and Universities in the U.S. Among the approximately 4,700 degree-granting institutions: Four-Year Colleges and Universities: Around 2,800 offer undergraduate and graduate degrees. These include public universities, private universities, liberal arts colleges, and specialized institutions. Public universities are generally larger with a broader range of programs, while private universities tend to be smaller and more expensive. Liberal arts colleges focus on a broad-based education with a smaller student body, and specialized institutions, such as art or technical schools, offer targeted programs of study. Two-Year Colleges : Approximately 1,800 are community colleges offering associate degrees and vocational programs. Community colleges are typically more affordable than four-year institutions and are designed to provide students with the skills needed to enter the workforce or transfer to a four-year college. It’s essential to note that these numbers are dynamic; new institutions are established, while others may close, and the definitions of “college” or “university” can vary from state to state. Why the Number of Colleges in the U.S. Matters Understanding the number of colleges in the U.S. is important for several reasons: Educational Diversity : The vast number of institutions ensures that there is something for everyone, whether a student is looking for a large public university, a small private college, or a specialized institution. Access to Education : With so many institutions, higher education is more accessible to people across different regions, demographics, and financial backgrounds. Economic Impact : Colleges and universities are significant contributors to the economy, not only through education but also by being major employers and centers for research and development. Conclusion: Finding the Right College for You With thousands of colleges and universities across the United States, students have a wealth of options to choose from. Whether you’re looking for a large public university, a private liberal arts college, or a specialized institution, there’s likely a perfect fit for your educational goals. It’s crucial to research and compare different types of institutions to find the one that aligns best with your needs and aspirations. The landscape of U.S. higher education continues to evolve, offering diverse opportunities for students to pursue their academic and career goals. Whether you’re considering a four-year degree, a community college program, or a specialized course of study, the U.S. has a rich array of options to explore.',\n",

Home\\n\\n A Guide to the Changing Number of U.S. Universities\\n\\n The U.S. Department of Education lists nearly 4,000 degree-granting academic institutions.\\n\\n By Josh Moody\\n |\\n April 27, 2021\\n |\\n By Josh Moody\\n |\\n April 27, 2021, at 9:30 a.m.\\n Save\\n More\\n\\n How Many Universities Are in the U.S.?\\n\\n More\\n\\n Getty Images\\n\\n Overall, the number of colleges in the U.S. is shrinking, particularly in the for-profit sector.\\n\\n\\n When it comes to determining how many colleges and universities are in the U.S., it\\'s a number in flux.\\n\\n The short answer: There were 3,982 degree-granting postsecondary institutions in the U.S. as of the 2019-2020 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\\n\\n The long answer: The total number depends on how university branch campuses are counted, as numerous institutions have satellite locations. The number also is subject to change in a higher education landscape that has experienced numerous recent college closures and mergers.\\n\\n Education is \"like any industry in the sense that you\\'ve got activity with firms growing, opening, closing, changing, merging continually,\" says Guilbert C. Hentschke, dean emeritus at the University of Southern California Rossier School of Education.\\n\\n Though the U.S. Department of Education tallies nearly 4,000 colleges and universities, U.S. News included just 1,452 schools in the 2021 rankings. To be eligible for inclusion in the Best Colleges rankings, a school must be regionally accredited and offer four-year undergraduate degree programs. Colleges that offer only associate degrees are not ranked, nor are schools with fewer than 200 students.\\n\\n Read:\\n\\n College vs. University: What\\'s the Difference?\\n\\n The Number of Public vs. Private Colleges\\n\\n Of the 3,982 institutions listed by NCES, there were 1,625 public four-year and two-year colleges; 1,660 private nonprofit four-year and two-year schools; and 697 for-profit schools in fall 2019. The data divides the institutions into subcategories such as four-year colleges and universities and two-year schools, often known as community colleges.\\n\\n Overall, the number of colleges in the U.S. has been on a steady decline since the 2012-2013 school year, particularly in the for-profit sector.\\n\\n \"Colleges are closing because they are struggling financially. Many for-profits closed because their enrollment fell off substantially in large part due to adverse publicity, challenges with their students getting financial aid and challenges that the (federal government) posed,\" Lucie Lapovsky, principal at Florida-based Lapovsky Consulting, former president of Mercy College in New York and an economist wrote in an email. She references stricter regulations on the for-profit sector as one contributing factor.\\n\\n What Drives College Closures\\n\\n While for-profit academic institutions have struggled in recent years with many closing, so too have small liberal arts colleges.\\n\\n \"Among the private colleges, those most susceptible to closing are the 800 private colleges with enrollment of (fewer) than 1,000 students. Schools that are small, schools that are almost entirely dependent on student revenues,\" Lapovsky says, adding that vulnerable institutions are threatened by a lack of adequate nontuition funding streams.\\n\\n Recent examples of such schools shutting down include Becker College in Massachusetts, which announced that it will close this year due to financial struggles exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\n Similarly, Mills College in California announced plans to wind down operations. Already struggling financially, the women\\'s college cited challenges brought on by COVID-19 as a reason for closing.\\n\\n Hentschke notes that there are many factors in play when it comes to college closures.\\n\\n \"It\\'s a combination of size, market location, market recognition and a brand that can either keep you afloat or conspire against you,\" Hentschke says. Despite market shifts, he notes the number of schools that close or merge is \"relatively small in a given year.\"\\n\\n Demographics also play a role. The declining birthrate in the U.S. means colleges compete for fewer undergraduate students.\\n\\n \"You look across all institutions and that number is going down, not up,\" Hentschke says.\\n\\n Instead of closing, some colleges merge with other institutions. In these cases, one college essentially absorbs another with some possible carryover of faculty and staff, Lapovsky explains. She points to the merger of Boston University and the former Wheelock College in Massachusetts, in which the former created the Wheelock College of Education & Human Development, thus keeping the Wheelock name alive.\\n\\n Prospective students worried about a college\\'s financial health and the potential for closure should look for red flags such as continually declining enrollment, budget deficits and a school\\'s diminishing endowment, experts say. These details often can be found online in college fact books, or interested students can contact a school directly for the information.\\n\\n Finding the Right College Fit\\n\\n With nearly 4,000 schools including branch campuses to choose from, students have an abundance of undergraduate degree options available whether ',\n",

The 4-year public sector was the only sector to see an increase in institutions. That increase included 16 institutions that were 2-year in 2022–2023 and became 4-year for 2023–24. The new data also shed light on tuition and fees in 2023–24, as well as unduplicated enrollment head counts. Additionally, new data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), show around 2.5 million high school students were enrolled in college courses for credit during the 2022 –23 academic year. \\n \\n \\n “Previous releases from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) have established that 2-year institutions are an educational resource for students who do not fit the profile of a “traditional” undergraduate student,” said NCES Commissioner Peggy G. Carr. “The new data released today improve our understanding of the role of 2-year institutions in educating such students, with information about their providing advanced coursework to high school students.” \\n Below are a few highlights from the data released today by NCES’s IPEDS program . \\n \\n The number of Title IV institutions in the U.S. and other jurisdictions decreased from 5,918 in 2022–23 to 5,819 in 2023–24. \\n Between the 2022–23 and 2023–24 academic years, adjusting for inflation, average tuition and fees for full-time, first-time degree or certificate-seeking undergraduates decreased across all sectors. \\n Of the roughly 3.6 million students receiving degrees or certificates at 4-year Title IV degree-granting institutions in 2023–24, about 54 percent received a bachelor’s degree. \\n \\n IPEDS is a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by NCES. IPEDS gathers information from U.S. colleges, universities, and technical and vocational institutions eligible to participate in any of the Title IV federal student financial aid programs. \\n The provisional fall collection release for 2023–24 includes data from 5,819 Title IV institutions and 70 administrative offices. Institutions that complete IPEDS surveys each year include research universities, state colleges and universities, private religious and liberal arts colleges, for-profit institutions, community and technical colleges, non-degree-granting institutions such as cosmetology schools, and others. \\n To access the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System data released today, please visit the IPEDS Data Explorer . \\n \\n Key Findings: \\n \\n Institutional Characteristics \\n \\n During the 2023–24 academic year, the number of Title IV institutions in the United States and other jurisdictions decreased approximately 2 percent from 5,918 in 2022–23 to 5,819.

These degree-granting schools follow Title IV guidelines, so you can use your federal financial aid to help pay tuition and fees. Each type of school serves a different demographic and budget because each school varies in how it receives and spends funding depending on its mission and goals. As a result, each offers programs specific to its purpose and student needs. \\n Public colleges and universities \\n Public colleges and universities are nonprofit schools and receive a majority of their funding from the federal government. They are often the largest of all institutions, offer a broad range of programs, and can be affordable. \\n \\n \\n Private colleges and universities \\n Nonprofit private schools receive their funding from the federal government, tuition, and donations. Money is reinvested back into the school to provide quality education and improve student outcomes and experiences. They are often smaller and more expensive than public institutions, and may offer a narrower scope of programs. For Profit schools are funded through private endowments and investors, federal grants, and tuition. They operate similar to businesses because a majority of their profits go back to their investors. As a result, these schools often face scrutiny. Some have been called \" diploma mills \" because of their nefarious student recruitment tactics and how they have spent their profits. \\n \\n \\n \\n Number of Public vs. Private Colleges in the U.S.\\n \\n As of the 2020-21 school year, there were 1,576 public and 2,160 private degree granting colleges and universities in the U.S. \\n \\n Number of Nonprofit vs. For Profit Colleges in the U.S.\\n \\n During the same time period, there were 3,154 nonprofit and 582 for profit institutes of higher learning across the country. \\n \\n \\n Four-year Schools \\n Four-year schools include public and private colleges and universities that primarily grant undergraduate and graduate degrees such as master\\'s , doctorates , and PhDs. \\n \\n There were 2,520 four-year and 1,216 two-year colleges and universities in the U.S. as of the 2020-21 school year. \\n \\n The Number of Colleges Offering Online Courses and Programs\\n \\n Out of a total 3,928 postsecondary degree granting institutions offering some level of distance education, there are 422 primarily offering online courses and programs as of Fall 2020. Collectively, these schools serve almost 19 million students at public, private, nonprofit, and for-profit colleges and universities. \\n \\n Number of Public vs. Private Online Colleges in the U.S.\\n \\n 1,586 public and 2,342 private colleges and universities offer online courses and degrees. \\n \\n Number of Nonprofit vs. For Profit Online Colleges in the U.S.\\n \\n There are 3,224 nonprofit and 704 profit schools in the U.S. where you can earn a degree online or take classes through distance learning. \\n \\n \\n \\n Number of Online Degrees Conferred By Level\\n \\n Schools conferred over 4 million degrees to online students in the 2019-20 school year: \\n \\n Associate degrees: 1,018,233 Bachelor\\'s degrees: 2,038,431 Master\\'s degrees: 843,449 Doctoral degrees: 190,178 \\n \\n \\n \\n What State Has the Most Colleges?\\n \\n California had 384 institutes of higher learning in the 2020-2021 school year, the most of any state in the U.S. In fact, the California community college system alone is the largest in the U.S. with 137 campuses serving approximately 2 million students . Including the community college system, there are 150 public, 142 nonprofit, and 92 for-profit colleges and universities throughout the state. The California Virtual Campus includes 115 community colleges featuring over 10,000 online courses, certificates, and degree programs. Cal State Online includes 23 campuses throughout the state that serve over 481,000 students remotely — you can earn a degree fully online or through a hybrid program where you learn on-campus 50% of the time. \\n \\n \\n \\n How To Choose a College\\n \\n Determine your career goals and the path you\\'ll need to take to achieve them. Once you decide on a career , find out what your earnings potential may be, the return on investment (ROI), your opportunities for career growth, and how it can be achieved. You can also look up job information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) and the Occupational Information Network ( O*NET ). Calculate your budget and how much financial aid you may be eligible to receive. After you figure out what it takes to meet your career goals, look at your financial situation and consider your budget — this will inform your choice of school and whether you choose public or private and two or four-year. You can also estimate what kind of federal financial aid you may be eligible to receive, and start researching scholarships to potentially help pay for tuition. Consider whether you want to attend school online or on campus. If you work full time, juggle multiple responsibilities, or live far from campus, you may want to consider attending online. Online programs offer convenience because classes are often asynchronous, allowing you to participate throughout the week as your schedule allows. However, if you enjoy campus life, actively engaging with your peers, and the structure of a classroom, you may choose to attend on campus. Think about how quickly you want to graduate. Once you determine what you\\'d like to study, you may want to think about how fast you\\'d like to finish. You may be able to enroll in an accelerated program that can shave up to a couple of years off the time spent in college. Or, you may want to take your time and enjoy breaks between terms by enrolling in a traditional-length degree program. Verify the school you are interested in is accredited. Accreditation ensures a school meets high academic quality standards. Always double-check to make sure your school is accredited by an U.S. Department of Education-approved agency and that your program is accredited if applicable. You can also check accreditation status with the Council for Higher Education Accreditation ( CHEA ). Check graduation and retention rates and student reviews. A school\\'s graduation and retention rates can paint a picture of how well they support students throughout their education and prepare them for careers after graduation — College Scorecard can verify this information. Reviews give more personal and anecdotal insight into the student experience which may also help you choose a school and program. The type of college you choose depends on several factors, including your educational and career goals, location, how quickly you want to finish, and how much money you have to spend. You can take several steps to ensure you make the right decision. \\n \\n \\n \\n FAQs About Colleges in the U.S.\\n \\n \\n Which State Is #1 in Higher Education?

It is also referred to as post-secondary education, third-stage, third-level, or tertiary education. It covers stages 5 to 8 on the International ISCED 2011 scale. It is delivered at 3,931 Title IV degree-granting institutions, known as colleges or universities . [ 1 ] These may be public or private universities , research universities , liberal arts colleges , community colleges , or for-profit colleges . U.S. higher education is loosely regulated by the government and by several third-party organizations and is in the process of being even more decentralized. \\n [ 2 ] [ 3 ] \\n Post secondary (college, university) attendance was relatively rare through the early 20th century. Since the decades following World War II , however, attending college or university has been thought of as \"a rite of passage\" to which the American Dream is deeply embedded. [ 4 ] Nonetheless, there is a growing skepticism of higher education in the U.S. and its value to consumers. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] U.S. higher education has also been criticized for encouraging a financial preference for the most prestigious institutions (e.g., Ivy League schools) over less selective institutions (e.g., community colleges). [ 7 ] \\n In 2022, about 16 million students—9.6 million women and 6.6 million men—enrolled in degree-granting colleges and universities in the U.S. Of the enrolled students, 45.8% enrolled in a four-year public institution, 27.8% in a four-year private institution, and 26.4% in a two-year public institution (four-years is the generally expected time to complete a bachelor\\'s degree , and two-years, an associates degree ). [ 8 ] College enrollment peaked in 2010–2011 and is projected to continue declining or be stagnant for the next two decades. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ needs update ] \\n Strong research funding helped elite American universities dominate global rankings in the early 21st century, making them attractive to international students , professors and researchers. [ 15 ] Higher education in the U.S. is also unique in its investment in highly competitive NCAA sports, particularly in American football and basketball , with large sports stadiums and arenas adorning its campuses and bringing in billions in revenue. [ 16 ] \\n \\n Colonial era to 19th century [ edit ] \\n The Wren Building , built at the College of William &amp; Mary in 1695, is the oldest academic building in the United States. The school held African slaves and their descendants for 170 years. \\n Religious denominations established early colleges in order to train white, male ministers. Between 1636 and 1776, nine colleges were chartered in Colonial America; today, these institutions are known as the colonial colleges . According to historian John Thelin , most instructors at these institutions were lowly paid \\'tutors\\'. [ 17 ] As objects of the slavocracy , African slaves and their descendants also served as free labor for more than a century and a half. [ 18 ] \\n Besides slavery, violence-backed cession was an aspect of higher education growth. This involved more than 200 indigenous nations, nearly 160 treaties and the appropriation of 11 million acres of land. \\n [ 19 ] \\n Protestants and Catholics opened hundreds of small denominational colleges in the 19th century. In 1899 they enrolled 46 percent of all US undergraduates. Many closed or merged but in 1905 there were over 500 in operation. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Catholics opened several women\\'s colleges in the early 20th century. Schools were small, with a limited undergraduate curriculum based on the liberal arts. Students were drilled in Greek, Latin, geometry, ancient history, logic, ethics and rhetoric, with few discussions and no lab sessions. Originality and creativity were not prized, but exact repetition was rewarded. College presidents typically enforced strict discipline, and upperclassman enjoyed hazing freshman. Many students were younger than 17, and most colleges also operated a preparatory school. There were no organized sports, or Greek-letter fraternities, but literary societies were active. Tuition was low and scholarships were few. Many of their students were sons of clergymen; most planned professional careers as ministers, lawyers or teachers. [ 22 ] \\n The nation\\'s small colleges helped young men make the transition from rural farms to complex urban occupations. These schools promoted upward mobility by preparing ministers and providing towns with a core of community leaders. Elite colleges became increasingly exclusive and contributed little upward social mobility . By concentrating on ministers and the offspring of wealthy families, elite Eastern colleges such as Harvard , Columbia , and Princeton played a role in the formation of a Northeastern elite. [ 23 ] \\n In some areas, public institutions of higher education were slow to take hold. For instance, although there was general support for expanding access to higher education through public institutions, private colleges and universities successfully hindered the establishment of a public university in Boston, Massachusetts until the 1860s. The competition between private and public institutions shaped the development of the mixed public-private character of higher education in the United States. [ 24 ] \\n \\n Catholic colleges and universities [ edit ] \\n The Main Building at the University of Notre Dame , a prominent Catholic university in Notre Dame, Indiana \\n The Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities was founded in 1899 and continues to facilitate the exchange of information and methods. [ 25 ] Vigorous debate in recent decades has focused on how to balance Catholic and academic roles, with conservatives arguing that bishops should exert more control to guarantee orthodoxy. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] \\n \\n Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) [ edit ] \\n Most Historically Black Colleges and Universities were established in the South after the American Civil War, often with the assistance of religious missionary organizations based in the northern United States. HBCUs established prior to the American Civil War include Cheyney University of Pennsylvania in 1837, University of the District of Columbia then known as Miner School for Colored Girls in 1851 and Lincoln University in 1854. [ 29 ] The second Morrill Act (1890) required that states consider black students equally or found separate land-grant schools for them. [ 30 ] \\n Protests for civil rights on campus began in the early 20th century, at Shaw University (1919), Fisk University (1924–1925), Howard University (1925) and Hampton Institute (1925, 1927). The protests often involved civil rights issues between black students and white administrators.

       "    'DATA_SOURCE_TEXT': 'This report was made possible with the support of \\n By Jasper McChesney and Jacqueline Bichsel | January 2020 \\n Introduction \\n America’s workforce is aging, and popular press articles have warned of a “silver tsunami” of retirements, particularly among the baby boomer generation. 1 Rowe, J. (2018, November 29). U.S. Aging Trends Are More Alarming Than We Thought. The Hill ; Soergel, A. (2015, December 24). Pretty Soon, Old People Will Have All the Jobs. U.S. News .\\n Dramatic headlines aside, even gradual changes in workforce demographics will affect hiring, budgeting, training, and more. Higher education tenure-track faculty may be uniquely affected by these demographic trends. 2 Non-tenure-track faculty, whether in teaching or research, are not examined in this report. These faculty exhibit quite different characteristics, and their role in higher ed is rapidly changing.\\n Faculty require long periods of training but often work beyond typical retirement ages; jobs are stable, and turnover is very low; the pipeline for new hires is fundamentally limited; and competition occurs nationally. As the workforce ages, this may create unique challenges for the management of a faculty workforce. \\n This report examines CUPA-HR data to consider how faculty are distributed by age, how age and rank interact in terms of salary, the representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities by age and rank, and variations of age across faculty disciplines. 3 Data were collected as part of CUPA-HR’s Faculty in Higher Education Survey from 2018. Data from for-profit institutions were omitted from all analyses. Demographic analyses omit incumbents that did not have the relevant variable reported (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity).\\n \\n Current Age Distribution of Faculty \\n Higher education tenure-track faculty require advanced training, so they are naturally older than typical U.S. workers — the median age in the U.S. labor force is 42 years compared to the median tenure-track faculty age of 49. There are also significantly more faculty aged 55 or older compared to the general workforce. Just 23% of all U.S. workers are 55 or older, compared to 37% of faculty. 4 U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018). Labor Force Statistics From the Current Population Survey. Table 18b: Employed Persons by Detailed Industry and Age. \\n The distribution of faculty ages is shown in Figure 1. Although the number of faculty begins to drop after age 65, 13% of faculty are 65 or older — compared to 6% of all U.S. workers. 5 Ibid.\\n \\n \\n Figure 1. Tenure-Track Faculty Rank and Age Distribution \\n Because it takes time to gain seniority, increases in rank are related to increases in age, as seen in the colored shading of Figure 1. As would be expected, most new assistant professors are in their thirties. Among tenure-track faculty older than 55, nearly two-thirds (65%) hold the rank of full professor, whereas more than one quarter (28%) are associate professors, and a small number (6%) are assistant professors. \\n Faculty Salaries by Age and Years in Rank \\n The median salary of tenure-track faculty increases steadily with age (Figure 2). Much of the increase can be attributed to the large salary differences between ranks. Full professors have the steepest slope in terms of differences in salary as age increases. Older full professors make much more than do younger full professors. For associate professors, older faculty have slightly higher salaries than do younger faculty. For assistant professors, there is very little difference in salary between older and younger faculty. \\n \\n Figure 2. Tenure-Track Faculty Pay by Age \\n Figure 3 depicts median salary differences by years in rank for each rank. Experience matters for full professors: those with more years in rank earn higher salaries. This is also true for associate professors, but only for those with more than five years in rank. Those associate professors who have not experienced a promotion to full professor can expect incremental increases in salary, although their salary remains proportionately lower than salaries of full professors. One can see from the graph that the median salary of an associate professor with 30 years in that rank ($90,865) is still lower than that of a full professor with less than one year in rank ($97,000). For assistant professors, median salaries increase with each year in rank up to five years (right before the point at which assistant professors generally go up for promotion). However, median salaries decrease with each year in this rank after that point. \\n \\n Figure 3. Tenure-Track Faculty Pay by Rank and Years in Rank \\n The Representation of Women and Racial/Ethnic Minorities by Age and Rank \\n The adequate representation of women and racial/ethnic minorities among faculty remains a concern in higher ed, particularly in the more senior academic ranks. 6 Bichsel, J.; Li, J.; Pritchard, A.; &amp; McChesney, J. (2018). Faculty in Higher Education Report: Key Findings, Trends, and Comprehensive Tables for Tenure-Track, Non-Tenure Teaching, and Non-Tenure Research Faculty; Academic Department Heads; and Adjunct Faculty at Four-Year Institutions for the 2017-18 Academic Year (Research Report). CUPA-HR.\\n Among all tenure-track faculty, women make up 45% of those aged 55 or younger and just 35% of those older than 55. Figure 4 shows the percentage of female faculty by age and rank. Across ranks, the percentage of women declines steadily with age cohort: over half (52%) of faculty in the youngest age group (25-30 years old) are women, but fewer than one-third (30%) in the oldest group (65-70) are. This overall decline is driven largely by a decline in women among full professors with increases in age. \\n \\n Figure 4. Representation of Women in Tenure-Track Faculty by Age and Rank \\n For all tenure-track faculty, racial/ethnic minorities comprise 26% of those 55 or younger and just 16% of faculty older than 55. Figure 5 shows an overall decline with age in the representation of racial/ethnic minorities. 7 Racial/ethnic minorities include anyone reported with a race/ethnicity status as something other than White. It does not include those classified as resident aliens or those whose race/ethnicity was unknown or unreported.\\n This appears to be due primarily to lack of promotion. With each increase in rank, from assistant to full professor, there is a decrease in the percentage of minorities. For example, looking at the median age of 49 for all tenure-track faculty, one sees the percentage of minorities is approximately 30% for assistant professors and approximately 20% for full professors. \\n \\n Figure 5. Representation of Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Tenure-Track Faculty by Age and Rank \\n Age Variations Between Disciplines \\n Academic disciplines vary substantially in the percentage of older faculty they employ (Figure 6). 8 Disciplines are defined by two-digit 2010 CIP codes established by IPEDs. Two disciplines are omitted in these analyses due to a low number of reported incumbents: personal and culinary services and science technologies/technicians.\\n Across all disciplines, the percentage of faculty 55 or older and the percentage of faculty at the full professor rank is the same (37%). However, these two figures vary greatly by discipline. Communications technologies has the lowest percentage of faculty older than 55 and also few full professors, which makes sense for a relatively young field. The opposite is seen in legal professions and studies which has both a large percentage of older faculty and a large percentage of full professors. \\n \\n Figure 6. Tenure-Track Faculty Older Than 55 by Discipline \\n Conclusions and Next Steps \\n Tenure-track faculty have a median age of 49, and many in the baby boomer generation are approaching retirement age. This could lead to increased turnover in the coming decade and increased competition in hiring new Ph.D.s. This impending wave of retirements has a number of implications a',\n",

I can say with a high degree of confidence that becoming a tenured professor is difficult. With the exception of community colleges and some rare special cases, you must have a PhD. Getting into a PhD is difficult, and engineering programs have the highest completion rate at about 2/3. Other fields have lower completion rates. In many fields, it's anywhere from difficult to well-nigh impossible to get a tenure-track assistant professorship. Regardless, once you have the job, you have to keep it. Tenure is not only a work process, it's a political process. Expectations for tenure are generally considered to have risen in the last few decades as the candidate pool increases at a much, much faster rate than tenure lines, which are often decreasing. You can work for six years, be successful, and be denied tenure. That means you typically have one year to find a new job. If you happen to get another tenure-line assistant professorship, you may be starting over, with another six years to try to earn tenure. And tenure is not a job for life. Annually, an averages of about 2% of tenured professors lose their jobs, vs. about 4% of all employees. Yes, a higher level of stability, but probably not when compared with other similar roles, and those roles don't have a six-year probationary period. I finished my PhD in 2009. I have been in tenure-line roles since 2015. I am still in tenured.

Please let us know if you have feedback .\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Dive Brief: \\n \\n Just 20.4% of U.S. institutions account for 80% of tenured and tenure-track faculty at Ph.D.-granting universities, giving prestigious colleges disproportionate influence over the spread of ideas, academic norms and culture. \\n That’s according to new research published in Nature, a peer-reviewed journal. It concluded that academia “is characterized by universally extreme inequality in faculty production.” \\n Just over one in eight domestically trained faculty were educated at five doctoral institutions: the University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Stanford University. The same five universities trained more faculty than all non-U.S. universities combined. \\n \\n Dive Insight: \\n A small minority of top universities trained most of the faculty at U.S. Ph.D.-granting institutions, essentially dominating the tenure-track hiring process, according to the research. \\n Even when researchers took field of study into account, 80% of faculty members were educated at only 19% to 28% of universities, depending on their field of study. Differences in university or department size didn\\'t explain the inequalities in faculty production. \\n Researchers studied the educational histories of faculty members who worked at the 386 Ph.D.-granting institutions in the U.S. between 2011 and 2020, representing almost 300,000 people. \\n They found that faculty members tend to be employed at universities considered less prestigious than those that trained them. A department is considered prestigious if it produces graduates who are hired by other well-regarded departments, according to the paper. Depending on their field of study, only about 5% to 23% of faculty members worked for a university more prestigious than the one at which they earned their Ph.D. \\n While these trends enable colleges to hire teaching staff from highly respected institutions, they also limit the employability of faculty graduating from less prestigious universities. This ultimately weakens the value of most colleges\\' programs. \\n These patterns worsen over time. Faculty members who weren’t trained at one of the small number of institutions dominating the academy are almost twice as likely to leave their professions each year, the paper found. \\n The research generated pushback online. On Twitter, Chris Marsicano, an educational studies professor at Davidson College, criticized that the paper only covered colleges that confer doctoral degrees, even though many professors work at institutions that don’t award Ph.D.s. \\n The exclusion of colleges without Ph.D. programs stemmed from a lack of data availability, according to Hunter Wapman, a computer science graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and co-author of the paper. \\n \"We would have loved to include non-PhD granting universities in the study, but we unfortunately didn\\'t have data for that cohort of faculty,\" Wapman said in an email. \"It would be wonderful if, in the future, we could report findings on that population — and, ideally, on graduate and undergraduate students, as well. \" \\n The Academic Analytics Research Center provided the data set used.',\n",

       "    'DATA_SOURCE_TEXT': 'For the first time since the pandemic began, the average salary has risen for full-time U.S. faculty members after adjusting for inflation, according to the American Association of University Professors’ annual pay survey. But while that’s welcome news, the raise was small—only about a half-percent uptick from fall 2022 to this past fall. \\n The tiny pay bump comes after years of COVID-19–era inflation eating away at faculty compensation, including entirely consuming institutions’ significant efforts in 2022 to raise wages. But at the same time, the AAUP found that inflation still outpaced salary increases at more than half of the 870 colleges and universities that reported full-time faculty pay information for the survey. And the news is worse for part-time faculty members, whose per-course-section pay actually declined in the new survey when adjusted for inflation. \\n The organization published the study’s preliminary results online Tuesday . It includes data from over 375,000 full-time and 92,000 part-time faculty members. Institutions must admit first-time undergraduate students to be included, so standalone graduate schools are excluded. \\n \\n \\n Most Popular \\n \\n \\n Brendan Cantwell, a professor of higher education at Michigan State University, said he thinks the increase in the average real wage “will be welcome news for faculty, but it will not fully address the concerns that many faculty have about the eroding purchasing power of their salaries.” He added, “what we’re not seeing is a real nationwide recognition of wage stagnation as a problem or a major priority for higher education.” \\n The survey shows that full-time faculty members’ average salary among the participating institutions has increased to $112,000. (With some exceptions, it includes data for nonmedical instructional faculty members.) In inflation-adjusted dollars, however, that’s still far below the $120,000 average in fall 2019, before the pandemic hit. And all categories of full-time faculty members, save for full professors (who now average over $155,000), make less than the average, so it’s not a good representation of faculty pay overall. \\n Another factor beyond full professors’ pay may also inflate the average salary. Glenn Colby, AAUP’s senior researcher, said the survey is “heavily biased” toward master’s and doctoral degree-granting institutions. “We have very low participation among community colleges and small liberal arts schools, which is not through lack of effort on our part,” he said. \\n The survey doesn’t provide explanations from colleges on why real wages are increasing so slowly. While persistent inflation is certainly a factor, colleges are also in an economic bind, said John Cheslock, an education policies studies professor at Pennsylvania State University. \\n “Because universities are often reliant upon their students for revenue, they’re in a catch-22 when it comes to faculty salaries,” Cheslock said. “They want to increase the salaries for their faculty, but they need to generate the revenue to pay for that. But generating more revenue from students makes it more challenging for them to reach other goals, such as affordability.” \\n But as Cantwell noted, “there’s not a lot of appetite to increase tuition,” which is now the biggest source of income even for most public institutions. Getting faculty members back to their pre-pandemic purchasing power, he said, will require either new revenue or prioritizing salaries over other institutional expenses. \\n Then there’s part-time faculty members’ plight. Colby said only 221 institutions reported the pay per standard course section for “adjunct” part-time faculty members for both this year’s survey and last year’s, and the part-time data is from all of last academic year instead of this past fall. After taking those caveats into account, part-timers only averaged $3,900 for each standard course section they taught last academic year. \\n That’s the same amount they made in the last annual report—and a 5.6 percent pay cut when you factor in inflation, Colby said. “The pay has been stuck at about $3,900 for several years among the institutions that provide the data,” he said. He called those wages “appalling,” and noted that most faculty members who are paid per course section don’t receive retirement or medical coverage contributions from their institutions. Overall, part-timers represented nearly half of all U.S. faculty members as of 2021, the AAUP previously reported. \\n Disparities by Rank, Sex and Institution Type \\n Columbia University’s $308,000 average salary for full-time, full professors ranks it the highest among all participating institutions, Colby said. Among public universities, the University of California, Los Angeles’s $266,000 average salary for full professors ranks it the highest among public doctoral universities that participated. But those are far cries from what most faculty members are paid. \\n The average full-time full professor now makes $155,000—still down from the $168,000 in real wages they made back in 2019. A salary chasm persists between the sexes: male full professors make $163,000, while their female peers make $142,000. The AAUP’s data isn’t broken down by race. \\n The average assistant professor, who is generally someone on the tenure track but hasn’t yet earned tenure, now makes $92,000. But for men, it’s $96,000, and for women, it’s $89,000—a narrower, but still significant, pay disparity. \\n Then there are the instructor and lecturer ranks. Full-time lecturers average $76,000 now, with men averaging $79,000 and women, $73,000. Instructors now average $69,000, with men getting $72,000 and women getting $67,000. \\n Disparities also remain wide among public institutions, religious institutions and private, nonprofit, non-religiously affiliated institutions. For example, the average salary for full professors is now $196,000 at the former institutions, compared to $145,000 at public institutions and $137,000 at religious institutions. \\n Barrett Taylor, a professor in the higher education program at the University of North Texas, spoke to another disparate impact of wage stagnation, one not easily seen in the data: the vastly different cost-of-living pressures depending on geographic area. “Real earnings have fallen quite a bit since the pandemic and you know that’s going to have asymmetric consequences for people,” Taylor said. \\n What can be done to increase wages amid a financial crunch for so many universities? Cantwell noted that “wages are more consistent in unionized campuses.” But he’s not sure the public or policymakers care much about faculty wage stagnation when their priorities lean more toward student costs and outcomes. Meanwhile, he said, “having a concerted effort to improve faulty working conditions is not something that state legislators are asking institutions to do”—nor is it something families are asking institutions about when they’re considering where to send their children.',\n",

But what does it even mean? \\n Simply put, an institution’s student to faculty ratio (or student-faculty ratio) is the number of students there are for every one professor at a given institution. It is calculated by dividing a school’s number of enrolled students by its number of teachers. For example, a school with 5,000 students and 500 professors has 10 students for every professor (i.e. a 10:1 ratio). \\n For reference, the National Center for Education Statistics found that the national average for college student-to-faculty ratios is 18:1. \\n How Important Is This Number to My College Search? \\n It is often said that a small student-faculty ratio is best, and understandably: when there are fewer students per professor, classes can be smaller, and every student is more likely to benefit from personalized attention. \\n All said, a school with a larger ratio does not always guarantee that students get lost in a sea of thousands of students. Colleges with larger populations do have more students per professor, but they can—and often do—make up for it with more robust resources on campus. A low student-faculty ratio has become synonymous with better, more personalized pedagogy, but that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to get the same from a larger university, just a bit less likely. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide how important this number is to you. \\n \\n \\n \\n Rank School Location Student to Faculty Ratio Acceptance Rate Net Price SAT Range \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 1 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA 3% 5% $21,519 1510-1580 \\n \\n \\n 2 California Institute of Technology Pasadena, CA 3% 3% $23,397 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 3 The Juilliard School New York, NY 4% 9% $42,468 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 4 Princeton University Princeton, NJ 5% 4% $19,811 1500-1580 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 5 University of Chicago Chicago, IL 5% 5% $27,979 1510-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 6 Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 5% 11% $32,964 1500-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 7 The New England Conservatory of Music Boston, MA 5% 43% $49,544 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 8 Williams College Williamstown, MA 6% 10% $16,988 1470-1560 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 9 Yale University New Haven, CT 6% 5% $26,044 1500-1580 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 10 Northwestern University Evanston, IL 6% 7% $23,341 1490-1560 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 11 Duke University Durham, NC 6% 7% $23,422 1510-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 12 Brown University Providence, RI 6% 5% $26,608 1500-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 13 Rice University Houston, TX 6% 8% $20,587 1500-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 14 Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 6% 8% $22,844 1530-1580 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 15 Columbia University in the City of New York New York, NY 6% 4% $20,869 1490-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 16 Stanford University Stanford, CA 6% 4% $17,998 1510-1580 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 17 University of North Carolina School of the Arts Winston Salem, NC 6% 33% $11,163 1150-1350 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 18 Manhattan School of Music New York, NY 6% 40% $51,879 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 19 American Musical and Dramatic Academy New York, NY 6% 25% $46,130 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 20 Cornish College of the Arts Seattle, WA 6% 70% $40,164 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 21 Gallaudet University Washington, DC 6% 61% $15,025 750-933 \\n \\n \\n 22 University of Holy Cross New Orleans, LA 6% 99% $14,476 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 23 Harvard University Cambridge, MA 7% 3% $17,900 1500-1580 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 24 Dartmouth College Hanover, NH 7% 6% $17,322 1500-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 25 Washington University in St Louis Saint Louis, MO 7% 12% $22,440 1500-1570 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 26 Pomona College Claremont, CA 7% 7% $17,423 1480-1560 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 27 Amherst College Amherst, MA 7% 10% $17,965 1360-1550 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 28 Vanderbilt University Nashville, TN 7% 6% $26,689 1510-1560 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 29 Wesleyan University Middletown, CT 7% 17% $20,463 1450-1540 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 30 Wellesley College Wellesley, MA 7% 14% $21,501 1440-1550 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 31 University of Richmond University of Richmond, VA 7% 23% $35,263 1410-1530 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 32 Yeshiva University New York, NY 7% 64% $38,118 1320-1500 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 33 Lawrence University Appleton, WI 7% 63% $27,393 1200-1430 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n 34 University of the Arts Philadelphia, PA 7% 78% $44,510 Test Blind \\n \\n \\n 35 Earlham College Richmond, IN 7% 74% $26,517 1178-1363 Test Optional \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n More Amazing Colleges &gt;&gt;&gt; \\n You may notice something about our 10 Best Student-Faculty Ratio Colleges; many accept less than 10% of the students that apply.

To meet rising demand, the number of faculty increased nationwide by just over 55 percent, from 515,684 to 800,611, between the 1993-1994 and 2013-2014 school years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the college faculty profession has one of the fastest growth rates in the nation and will see a 19 percent increase in jobs between 2012 and 2022. [1] [2] [3] \\n A growing portion of these jobs are part-time or adjunct faculty and teaching and research assistants, as opposed to full-time tenured faculty members. By the mid-1990s, part-time faculty comprised over half of total instructional faculty, a figure which continued to increase before leveling off in 2013. As of the 2013-2014 school year, part-time faculty at public four-year institutions, including teaching and research assistants, comprised 55.1 percent of the total number of faculty nationwide, up from 48.5 percent 20 years earlier. This figure was even higher at public two-year institutions: 69 percent. The BLS expects this trend to continue into the future. [1] [4] \\n Additionally, just like the college student population, the demographics of college faculty are shifting, with the most dramatic shift occurring in the numbers of male and female faculty. By the 2013-2014 school year, the percentages of female, black and Hispanic faculty members had reached their highest levels ever: 42.3 percent, 5.4 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. [1] \\n The tables below provide specific information by state on the employment status, salaries and demographics of faculty members at postsecondary institutions.\\n \\n Employment status \\n 2013-2014 \\n Employment of faculty at four-year public institutions \\n At four-year institutions, the percentage of part-time faculty, including teaching and research assistants, increased from 48.5 percent in the 1993-1994 school year to 55.1 percent in the 2013-2014 school year. The number of part-time faculty, including teaching and research assistants, outnumbered full-time faculty in all but 11 states. The number of teaching and research assistants alone outnumbered full-time faculty in five states. According to the Southern Regional Education Board : [1] \\n \\n \\n \\n “\\n \\n The fact that part-time faculty and teaching/research assistants are a majority of the instructional staff does not mean they do a majority of the instruction, because part-time faculty members and teaching/research assistants typically do not teach as many classes as full-time faculty members. Part-time faculty members generally do not have campus committee assignments or participate in student activities.

Between fall 2011 and fall 2022, the total annual number of faculty at degree-granting postsecondary institutions ranged from 1.5 to 1.6 million. 1 There were 1.5 million faculty in both 2011 and 2022, with a peak at 1.6 million in 2015. \\n Considering full-time faculty only, 2 in fall 2022, \\n \\n 72 percent of faculty were White, specifically 35 percent White female and 37 percent White male; \\n 13 percent of faculty were Asian, specifically 6 percent Asian female and 7 percent Asian male; \\n 7 percent of faculty were Black, specifically 4 percent Black female and 3 percent Black male; \\n 6 percent of faculty were Hispanic, specifically 3 percent each Hispanic female and Hispanic male; \\n 1 percent were of Two or more races; \\n less than one-half of 1 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native; and \\n less than one-half of 1 percent were Pacific Islander. \\n \\n The racial/ethnic and sex distribution of full-time faculty varied by academic rank at degree-granting postsecondary institutions in fall 2022. For example, White males and Asian males made up higher percentages of faculty in the professor ranks than they did in the nonprofessor ranks. 3 Specifically, 39 percent of professor-rank faculty were White males and 8 percent were Asian males. Meanwhile, 33 percent of nonprofessor-rank faculty were White males and 5 percent were Asian males. Other demographic groups made up similar or lower percentages of faculty in the professor ranks compared with the nonprofessor ranks. 4 For example, Hispanic females made up 3 percent of faculty in professor ranks and 4 percent in nonprofessor ranks. \\n \\n 1 For general technical notes related to data analysis, data interpretation, rounding, and other considerations, please refer to the Condition of Education Reader�s Guide . \\n 2 Percentages are based on full-time faculty whose race/ethnicity was known (90 percent of total). Race/ethnicity was not collected for faculty who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents. \\n 3 Professor-rank faculty include professors, associate professors, and assistant professors. Nonprofessor-rank faculty include instructors, lecturers, and those who were primarily research or public service faculty, as well as faculty without ranks. \\n 4 Asian females and Black males also made up higher percentages of faculty in the professor ranks than they did in the nonprofessor ranks. However, the differences in these percentages were less than one-half of 1 percentage point. \\n SOURCE: National Center for Education Statistics. (2024). Characteristics of Postsecondary Faculty.
