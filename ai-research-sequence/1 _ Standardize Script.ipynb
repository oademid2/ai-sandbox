Most work full time, although part-time work is common. \\n \\n How to Become a Postsecondary Teacher \\n \\n \\n Educational requirements vary by subject and the type of educational institution. Typically, postsecondary teachers must have a Ph.D. However, a master's degree may be enough for some postsecondary teachers at community colleges, and others may need work experience in their field of expertise. \\n \\n Pay \\n \\n The median annual wage for postsecondary teachers was $83,980 in May 2024. \\n \\n Job Outlook \\n Overall employment of postsecondary teachers is projected to grow 8 percent from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations.\\n \\n \\n \\n About 118,900 openings for postsecondary teachers are projected each year, on average, over the decade.\\n \\n Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire. \\n \\n State &amp; Area Data \\n Explore resources for employment and wages by state and area for postsecondary teachers. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Similar Occupations \\n \\n Compare the job duties, education, job growth, and pay of postsecondary teachers with similar occupations. \\n \\n \\n More Information, Including Links to O*NET \\n \\n \\n Learn more about postsecondary teachers by visiting additional resources, including O*NET, a source on key characteristics of workers and occupations. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n What Postsecondary Teachers Do \\n \\n About this section \\n \\n Professors may teach a variety of subjects, such as history, science, or business. \\n \\n Postsecondary teachers instruct students in a variety of academic subjects beyond the high school level. They may also conduct research and publish scholarly papers and books. \\n Duties \\n Postsecondary teachers typically do the following: \\n \\n Develop an instructional plan (known as a course outline or syllabus) for the course(s) they teach and ensure that it meets college and department standards \\n Plan lessons and assignments \\n Teach courses in their subject area \\n Assess students’ progress by grading assignments, papers, exams, and other work \\n Advise students about which courses to take and how to achieve their goals \\n Work with colleagues to develop or modify the curriculum for a degree or certificate program involving in-person, online, or hybrid delivery of course material \\n Stay informed about changes and innovations in their field \\n Serve on academic or administrative committees, as needed \\n \\n Postsecondary teachers, often referred to as professors or faculty , specialize in a variety of subjects and fields. At colleges and universities, professors are organized into departments by degree field, such as history, science, or business. A professor may teach one or more courses within that department. For example, a mathematics professor may teach calculus, statistics, and a graduate seminar on a topic related to polynomials. \\n Postsecondary teachers’ duties vary, often based on the size of their employing institution. In large colleges or universities, they may teach courses, conduct research or experiments, publish original research, apply for grants to fund their research, or supervise graduate teaching assistants. In small colleges and universities or in community colleges, they may spend most of their time teaching courses and working with students. \\n Full-time professors, particularly those who have tenure (that is, they cannot be fired without just cause), often are expected to devote a great deal of time on original research. Tenured professors must document their analyses or critical reviews and publish their research findings. They also may be expected to serve on college and university committees. \\n Part-time professors, often known as adjunct professors , usually spend most of their time teaching students. \\n Professors may teach large classes of several hundred students (often with the help of graduate teaching assistants), smaller classes of about 40 to 50 students, seminars with a few students, or laboratories in which students practice the subject matter. Some teach online, either exclusively or in addition to providing live instruction. \\n Professors’ tasks also may include collaborating with their colleagues and attending conferences to keep up with developments in their field. \\n Information about postsecondary teachers who provide vocational training in subjects such as repair, transportation, and cosmetology is available in the profile on career and technical education teachers . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Work Environment About this section \\n \\n Most classes are held during the day, but some are held on nights and weekends. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Postsecondary teachers held about 1.4 million jobs in 2023.

In the U.S., the word \"professor\" is often used to refer to anyone who teaches at a college of university level at any academic rank . [ 1 ] This usage differs from the predominant usage of the word professor in other countries, where the unqualified word \"professor\" only refers to \"full professors\" (i.e., the highest rank among regular faculty), nor is it generally used in the United States for secondary education teachers. Other tenure-track faculty positions include assistant professor (entry level) and associate professor (mid-level). Other teaching-focused positions that use the term \"professor\" include Clinical Professor, Professor of Practice, and Teaching Professor (specific roles and status vary widely among institutions, but usually do not involve tenure). Most faculty with titles of \"Lecturer\" and \"Instructor\" in the U.S. are not eligible for tenure, though they are still often referred to as \"professors\" in a general sense and as a courtesy form of address. [ 2 ] Non-tenure-track positions may be full or part time, although the qualifier \"adjunct\" always denotes part-time (whether combined with the word \"professor\" or not).\\n Research and teaching are among the main tasks of tenured and tenure-track professors, with the amount of time spent on research or teaching depending strongly on the type of institution. Publication of articles in conferences, journals, and books is essential to occupational advancement. [ 3 ] In 2011, a survey conducted by TIAA-CREF Institute senior researcher Paul J. Yakoboski estimated that 73% of professors with senior tenure ranged between the ages of 60 and 66 and that the remaining 27% were above the age of 66. [ 4 ] Yakoboski estimated that 75% of these professors have acknowledged that they have made no preparations for retirement due to the ongoing financial crisis and reluctance to leave their profession. [ 4 ] A 2013 survey conducted by Fidelity Investments would echo similar results when the question about retirement came up. [ 5 ] \\n In 2020, the National Center for Education Statistics counted 189,692 professors, 162,095 associate professors, 166,543 assistant professors, 96,627 instructors, 44,670 lecturers, and 164,720 other full-time faculty. [ 6 ] \\n \\n The term \"professors\" in the United States refers to a group of educators at the college and university level . In the United States, while \"Professor\" as a proper noun (with a capital \"P\") generally implies a position title officially bestowed by a university or college to faculty members with a PhD or the highest level terminal degree in a non-academic field (e.g., MFA, MLIS), [ citation needed ] the common noun \"professor\" is often used casually to refer to anyone teaching at the college level, regardless of rank or degree. At some junior colleges without a formal ranking system, instructors are accorded the courtesy title of \"professor\".\\n Although almost all tenured professors hold doctorates, [ citation needed ] some exceptional scholars without them are occasionally granted tenure: Jay Forrester (electrical engineering, M.I.T. ) had only a master\\'s degree; Saul Kripke (philosophy, Rockefeller ) and Andrew Gleason (mathematics, Harvard ) had only a bachelor\\'s degree; Edward Fredkin (computer science, M.I.T. ) and Erik Erikson (psychology, Harvard) did not even have bachelor\\'s degrees. Tenure without a doctorate is somewhat more common in fields with an artistic component, as with Howard Nemerov (poetry, Washington University in St. Louis ) and Colin Rowe (architectural history and theory, Cornell ). Until the middle of the 20th century, professors without doctorates were more common.\\n \\n Tenured and tenure-track positions [ edit ] \\n These full-time faculty members with PhDs or other highest-level terminal degrees (designated as acceptable by a university or college, including the \"professional equivalent\" to the doctorate at institutions such as Columbia University [ 7 ] ), engage in both undergraduate and graduate teaching, mentoring, research, and service. Only faculty in these positions are eligible for tenure .\\n \\n Assistant Professor : An introductory level professor. A position generally taken after receiving a PhD and often, especially in the sciences, completing a post-doctoral fellowship. After 7 years, in most American colleges and universities, a tenure-track faculty member (usually assistant professor) must be either awarded tenure, or dismissed from the university . \\n Associate Professor : A mid-level, usually tenured, professor. \\n Professor (sometimes referred to as \"Full Professor\" ): a senior, tenured professor. \\n Distinguished Professor or Endowed Chair (e.g., \"the Brian S. Smith Professor of Physics\"): An honorary position in which a full professor\\'s salary may be increased, perhaps by being tied to an endowment derived from the university, private individuals, firms, or foundations. \\n The top administrative post in many academic departments is the \"department chair .\" Prior to the 1970s, such administrators were called \"chairmen\" or \"chairwomen\", but the term in most institutions has since been the gender-neutral \"chairperson\", or shortened to \"chair\". While many department chairs also hold endowed chair positions, the two positions are distinct.\\n Educators who hold a formal title of \"Professor\" (referred to as tenured/tenure-track faculty) typically begin their careers as assistant professors (or \"lecturers\" and \"senior lecturers\"), with subsequent promotions to the ranks of associate professor and finally professor . The titles are historical traditions; for example, it is not implied that an assistant professor \"assists\" more senior faculty. There is often a strict timeline for application for promotion from assistant to associate professor, most often 5 or 6 years following the initial appointment. Applicants are evaluated based on their contributions to research, teaching, and administration. The relative weightings of these contributions differ by institution, with PhD-granting universities usually placing more emphasis on research and liberal arts colleges placing more emphasis on teaching. The decision to grant tenure and promotion from assistant to associate professor usually requires numerous levels of approval, with a common sequence being:\\n \\n external reviewers—several nationally or internationally prominent academics in the candidate\\'s field will be asked to review the candidate\\'s application for promotion and submit a confidential report; \\n based on this report and evidence of the candidate\\'s accomplishments in his or her curriculum vitae, a committee of members from the candidate\\'s department will make a recommendation for tenure/promotion or denial of such; \\n the department will vote; \\n the department decision is communicated to a university panel of individuals from outside of the department who evaluate the application and decide whether they agree or disagree with the departmental recommendation; \\n the dean; \\n the board of governors/president or other upper level governing body. \\n A decision to reject a candidate for tenure normally requires that the individual leave the institution within two years (under the AAUP tenure guidelines). Otherwise, tenure is granted along with promotion from assistant to associate professor. Although tenure and promotion are usually separate decisions, they are often highly correlated such that a decision to grant a promotion coincides with a decision in favor of tenure, and vice versa. Promotion to associate professor usually results in an increased administrative load and membership on committees that are restricted to tenured faculty.\\n Some people remain at the level of associate professor throughout their careers. However, most will apply for the final promotion to full professor; the timeline for making this application is more flexible than that', 'DATA_POINT': 824347, 'DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW': \"The text provides an overview of the various faculty positions and titles that exist within colleges and universities in the United States. It explains how the term 'professor' can refer broadly to anyone teaching at the college level, though it is usually reserved for those with specific ranks such as assistant, associate, and full professor. The text outlines the career progression for tenured and tenure-track positions, noting the importance of research, teaching, and service duties.

This week: uncovering where most US professors get their PhDs. Host: Benjamin Thompson And the latest from the Nature Briefing . I’m Benjamin Thompson. Host: Nick Petrić Howe And I’m Nick Petrić Howe. [Jingle] Interviewer: Nick Petrić Howe We know a lot of you listening have PhDs, and if you’re part of the subset of that group who are US-based and working at an institution with tenure track, I might also be able to take a good guess at where you got that PhD, thanks to a new paper published in Nature . This study has looked at a huge dataset of US faculty from 2011-2020 to get an understanding of where they were all trained and then where they ended up working. The answer may not surprise you. To find out more, I caught up with one of the authors, Dan Larremore, and started by asking him what we already know about US faculty. Interviewee: Dan Larremore Most faculty come from a minority of institutions, so there's inequality in faculty placement or production. And if you sort the institutions by which institutions they draw their faculty from, a social hierarchy emerges. It's not exactly a pecking order. These are endorsement interactions. If my institution hires a graduate from the University of New Mexico, my institution is implicitly endorsing the quality of the candidate that came from that institution. And so, if you zoom out, you can understand a hierarchy of prestige and endorsement, simply from the flows of faculty hiring. And past studies have identified in individual fields, in individual snapshots in time, that these kinds of patterns exist. What hasn't been known is whether or not these patterns are ubiquitous across fields, whether some fields show steeper hierarchies than others, and how these patterns are evolving over time. Interviewer: Nick Petrić Howe And so, given this kind of background, what was your motivation for your new paper? What sort of questions were you trying to answer? Interviewee: Dan Larremore This paper starts from the observation that oftentimes, when somebody gives a presentation, or is introduced as a speaker, or just introduced in general, one of the things that comes along with their name is their credentials. And this sort of raises a larger question of like, well, where do professors come from at a large scale? So, in this study, led by my graduate student Hunter Wapman, what we did was analyse all of the tenure-track faculty at PhD-granting institutions in the US over a decade. That amounted to around 300,000 professors, 368 institutions in around 10,500 departments. Interviewer: Nick Petrić Howe And when you looked at this data, what did you find? Interviewee: Dan Larremore Well, our first question was, where do professors come from? And we answered this first by looking at national origins. So, it turns out that around 11% of faculty come from outside of the US in their doctoral training. It’s not national origin, but around 11% of faculty have their PhDs from outside the US. It turns out that this varies a lot by field. So, for example, in education, 2% of professors got their doctorates outside of the US. In natural sciences, this was 19%. When we dig down a little bit further and we look at country of origin, we found that among those US professors who were trained outside the US, around 35% came from Canada and the UK alone. I want to contrast that with another number, which is the total professors who were trained doctorally in Africa and all of the Americas, excluding Canada and the US, and that was just around 5%. So, a huge fraction of the faculty who are coming into the US from abroad are trained in the UK and Canada, and a small minority are coming from Africa and the rest of the Americas. Interviewer: Nick Petrić Howe And you also then looked at people who got their doctorates within the US, and what did you find here? Where were these people coming from? Interviewee: Dan Larremore So, in the US, what we found was that there is stark inequality in production. What you might say is that the United States tenure-track hiring market is dominated by a small minority of institutions. So, for example, this follows the Pareto principle or an 80-20 rule, where 80% of US-trained faculty come from only 20.4% of institutions. Another way of looking at that is to say that 1 in 8 US professors comes from just 5 US institutions. And these five institutions train more than all of the non-US faculty combined. So, in general, what you could say is that the US faculty hiring market is really unequal in terms of where professors come from. Interviewer: Nick Petrić Howe And so, the places, this sort of 20% where 80% of the faculty are coming from, are they mostly prestigious universities, or do we not know this yet? Interviewee: Dan Larremore They are mostly prestigious. What we can do is actually measure prestige directly from faculty hiring networks. And in fact, what we find is that there's again inequality when it comes to prestige in these systems. So, basically, the elite positions in these hierarchies of prestige are occupied by just a few institutions, and most institutions have no departments at all that are in those elite top slots. Interviewer: Nick Petrić Howe And as I understand that is well, your data also gave some insights into the gender of the faculty. What are you able to tell me about this? Interviewee: Dan Larremore That's right. So, we were also interested in understanding gender inequality in the academy. And the first thing that we did was we looked year by year between 2011 and 2020 at the different fields and their gender representation over time. And essentially what we found is that women's representation has been increasing in almost every field, but not for the reasons that we might think. Because we could identify new hires and we could identify attritions, so people who left the academy early or who retired, we could compare women's representation in those inflows into the academy versus the representation of the outflows. And essentially what we find is that in almost every field there are more women who are coming in and more men who are going out. And when you look at the demographic curves, this really explains what's happening. Retirement-age faculty tend to be far more likely to be men than newly hired faculty. One question that we had was whether or not the percentage of women among newly hired faculty was itself changing over time. And we essentially found that hiring rates for women are flat over a decade of observation. So, what this is telling us is that the increases that we've seen in women's representation in the US academy have been driven by past changes in hiring, which are creating these demographic waves that are making their way through, or we have more men retiring and more women being hired. But what we don't see is continued change at the hiring stage. So, this is especially important for areas like mathematics and computing, engineering and natural sciences, where, still today, men are more likely to be hired than women, suggesting that without future efforts to change things at the hiring stage, we're unlikely to see gender parity over the next decade. Interviewer: Nick Petrić Howe You've found these stark inequalities in where US faculty are coming from. What sort of impacts do you think this could have on the sort of institution of science or the institution of education and learning? Interviewee: Dan Larremore Where faculty come from makes a difference in the questions that they ask. And in fact, their affiliations are known to affect things like paper acceptance rates. Prestigious affiliations increase the likelihood that one's paper gets accepted. Faculty-prestigious universities have more resources, they write more papers, they receive more citations and attention, they win more awards, and their graduates go on to experience greater wage growth. So, we know that where professors come from and \", 'DATA_POINT': 300000, 'DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW': \"The text is an interview discussing a study that analyzed US faculty with PhDs over a decade. The study found significant inequality in faculty origins, showing that a small number of prestigious institutions produce the majority of US-trained professors. It also highlights the contribution of international PhDs, particularly from Canada and the UK. Additionally, it examines gender representation trends, noting that increases in women's representation are largely due to higher male retirements rather than changes in hiring practices.

To meet rising demand, the number of faculty increased nationwide by just over 55 percent, from 515,684 to 800,611, between the 1993-1994 and 2013-2014 school years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the college faculty profession has one of the fastest growth rates in the nation and will see a 19 percent increase in jobs between 2012 and 2022. [1] [2] [3] \\n A growing portion of these jobs are part-time or adjunct faculty and teaching and research assistants, as opposed to full-time tenured faculty members. By the mid-1990s, part-time faculty comprised over half of total instructional faculty, a figure which continued to increase before leveling off in 2013. As of the 2013-2014 school year, part-time faculty at public four-year institutions, including teaching and research assistants, comprised 55.1 percent of the total number of faculty nationwide, up from 48.5 percent 20 years earlier. This figure was even higher at public two-year institutions: 69 percent. The BLS expects this trend to continue into the future. [1] [4] \\n Additionally, just like the college student population, the demographics of college faculty are shifting, with the most dramatic shift occurring in the numbers of male and female faculty. By the 2013-2014 school year, the percentages of female, black and Hispanic faculty members had reached their highest levels ever: 42.3 percent, 5.4 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. [1] \\n The tables below provide specific information by state on the employment status, salaries and demographics of faculty members at postsecondary institutions.\\n \\n Employment status \\n 2013-2014 \\n Employment of faculty at four-year public institutions \\n At four-year institutions, the percentage of part-time faculty, including teaching and research assistants, increased from 48.5 percent in the 1993-1994 school year to 55.1 percent in the 2013-2014 school year. The number of part-time faculty, including teaching and research assistants, outnumbered full-time faculty in all but 11 states. The number of teaching and research assistants alone outnumbered full-time faculty in five states. According to the Southern Regional Education Board : [1] \\n \\n \\n \\n “\\n \\n The fact that part-time faculty and teaching/research assistants are a majority of the instructional staff does not mean they do a majority of the instruction, because part-time faculty members and teaching/research assistants typically do not teach as many classes as full-time faculty members. Part-time faculty members generally do not have campus committee assignments or participate in student activities.

The ratio represents the number of students compared to the number of college professors at an institution. Schools may also call this the student-to-professor ratio. Institutions factor in part-time students and college faculty when calculating student-to-professor ratios. \\n This ratio can shape a student\\'s undergraduate experience. Learners should understand the student-to-faculty ratio at each of their top schools. This article explores data and information about the ideal student-to-faculty ratio for each learner. \\n What Does Student Faculty Ratio Mean? \\n A school\\'s student-to-faculty ratio can provide useful information for prospective students. However, learners should also consider the school\\'s teaching environment and undergraduate experience when choosing a school. \\n Many colleges use a low ratio as a selling point. A low ratio usually indicates smaller class sizes. However, that may not hold at schools with high numbers of research faculty. As a result, prospective students need to look beyond the ratio to understand the academic environment. \\n Smaller class sizes can lead to more personalized attention for students. Larger institutions and those with higher ratios generally offer more lecture-style classes. Smaller schools and private nonprofit institutions often report lower student-to-faculty ratios. Most liberal arts colleges prioritize a low ratio. \\n A high student-to-faculty ratio does not always mean that a school holds all classes in large lecture halls. Programs and departments may report lower ratios than the school as a whole. Also, class sizes change as students progress through their degrees. While large institutions may enroll hundreds of students in general education courses , upper-level major classes often have smaller class sizes. \\n What Is a Good Student Faculty Ratio? \\n When identifying a good student-to-faculty ratio, students should consider their preferred academic experience. Some students want to take classes in large lecture halls. Others prefer smaller classes with more focused attention from college faculty. This section introduces data about low, average, and high student-to-faculty ratios. \\n What Is a Low Student Faculty Ratio? \\n What is a small student-to-faculty ratio? According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the overall student-to-faculty ratio at degree-granting institutions was 14-to-1 in 2018. A ratio below that number may be considered low. Typically, private nonprofit colleges maintain lower student-to-faculty ratios than public schools. According to NCES data, public universities reported a 14-to-1 ratio in 2018, while private universities had a 10-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio. \\n Private schools and small liberal arts colleges often report the lowest ratios. Williams College, Northwestern University, and Yale University have a 6-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio, according to IPEDS data . Because of their high number of research professors, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology each report a 3-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio. \\n Institutions often use a low ratio as a selling point to attract applicants. A low student-to-faculty ratio often translates to small class sizes and personalized attention from professors. Students at these schools may complete more supervised research projects. However, a small ratio does not guarantee small class sizes or individual attention. The number of college faculty members who teach courses also impacts the student experience. \\n \\n \\n What Is an Average Student Faculty Ratio? \\n In 2018, 1.5 million college professors worked in the United States, according to the NCES . The average student-to-faculty ratio for degree-granting U.S. institutions was 14-to-1. That number includes full-time and part-time professors, along with students with various enrollment statuses. \\n The average ratio varies by type of school. In 2018, private for-profit institutions reported a 22-to-1 ratio, according to the NCES. In contrast, public four-year institutions reported a student-to-faculty ratio about the same as the national average. Private nonprofit four-year schools had a 10-to-1 ratio. \\n Many state and mid-sized schools report average ratios. For example, according to IPEDS data , the University of Louisville and SUNY Buffalo State have a 14-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio. Students at these schools take both seminar-style courses and large lecture classes. Depending on the size of the institution, undergraduates may take classes taught by graduate instructors. \\n \\n What Is a High Student Faculty Ratio? \\n A student-to-faculty ratio that exceeds the national average of 14 students per faculty member is typically considered high. What colleges have the highest student-to-faculty ratios? Many large universities report higher ratios. For example, the University of Central Florida enrolls nearly 70,000 students and reports a 30-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio, according to IPEDS data . But large schools do not always have high ratios. The University of Arizona enrolls nearly 45,000 students and has a 15-to-1 ratio. \\n Schools with high student-to-faculty ratios typically report larger class sizes. Courses at large schools may enroll more than 300 students. However, learners at schools with above-average student-to-faculty ratios may also attend small classes. At Oregon State University , which reports an 18-to-1 ratio, only 17% of courses enroll more than 100 students. \\n When evaluating colleges, prospective students can compare the number of learners and faculty members. However, applicants should also consider each school\\'s class sizes, retention rate, and faculty-directed research project opportunities. \\n More Resources for Finding the Right College \\n College students should choose a school that fits their unique needs. Some students thrive in settings with low student-to-faculty ratios. Others prefer large institutions with more professors. The following resources can help learners find a college that fits their preferences. \\n \\n \\n Genevieve Carlton \\n \\n \\n Genevieve Carlton holds a Ph.D. in history from Northwestern University and earned tenure as a history professor at the University of Louisville.

Roughly half of the UNC budget consists of professors’ salaries. \\n UNC faculty supposedly taught an average of 3.7 classes in the Fall semester of 2012, according to the Delaware Study of Instructional Costs and Productivity. The Delaware Study is used to determine the official workload statistics at UNC schools and many other colleges and universities across the country. \\n That 3.7 figure seems to be too high, considering that most of the university system’s faculty work at large research institutions where they are expected to teach an average of 2.0 or 2.5 courses per semester. A closer look suggests that it may be not only inaccurate but perhaps deliberately so. \\n One glaring reason why the Delaware Study’s figures for the UNC system are likely to be an inaccurate measure of actual teaching loads is the way part-time professors are handled. The 3.7 average courses taught is for “full-time equivalent” (FTE) professors. This includes not just the tenure-track professors (used as a term that includes tenured professors as well), but full-time non-tenured lecturers, part-time teachers known as adjunct professors, and graduate students who also teach part-time. It defines an FTE professor as any combination of part-time teachers whose course loads add up to four. The teaching load of these FTE professors are then added to those of full-time professors and lecturers to arrive at an average workload of the department, school, or system. That is what the 3.7 figure represents. \\n But this process is circular—and therefore provides no worthwhile information. If, by definition, the workloads of all adjunct professors and graduate students will always be converted to an FTE load of four courses, then the workload of one FTE professor will never deviate from four. Adding the FTE teachers to tenure-track professors will almost always inflate the average course-load of a department or university, as most tenure-track professors average fewer than four courses per semester. \\n Furthermore, it is more important for taxpayers and legislators to know the teaching loads of highly paid tenure-track professors who also have other duties, rather than the teaching loads of those who are strictly hired to teach. While the UNC system has not yet revealed the 2012 figures for tenure-track professors, the Pope Center has obtained the official tenure-track teaching load average for Appalachian State University for the Fall of 2011: it is 3.2 courses per semester. But is it correct? \\n Appalachian State is a particularly good representative example: while not a large research institute, it is the sixth largest school in the system, the largest of the non-research intensive schools. And its official FTE average for the Fall of 2011 was 3.6, just .1 over the system average of 3.5, while its 3.7 course average for 2012 FTE average was exactly the system average of 2012. \\n The Pope Center is conducting its own faculty teaching load study, and we were provided access to some official enrollment data at Appalachian sent to Delaware Study researchers for the Fall of 2011. This data had gone through a “grooming” process from the “raw” data found on the registrar’s website. The grooming consisted of adjustments made jointly by an ASU staff member and the department heads for use in the Delaware Study. \\n The Pope Center computed teaching load averages in strict accordance with the Delaware Study guidelines for both groomed and raw sets of data for a three-department sample at Appalachian State. We found anomalies in the university’s groomed data for the Fall of 2011, such as courses mislabeled as lectures, which count toward the workload average, rather than as independent study classes, which do not. These anomalies inflated the Biology department’s official average for tenure-track professors from 3.0 courses to 3.8 courses. \\n It also drove up the average for our three-department sample (History and Economics were the other two) from 2.8 to 3.3—just above the school’s official 3.2 Delaware Study average for that semester. The difference between the official figure and our findings is not just a rounding error—a 0.4 increase in tenure-track faculty workloads strictly applied throughout the entire UNC system would mean savings in excess of $100 million. \\n The problems seen in ASU’s data and its excessively high average may not be exceptional within the UNC system. Although Appalachian State is the only school for which we were able to compare the official Delaware Study average tenure-track teaching loads with the Pope Center findings, it is somewhat middle-of-the pack or lower when it comes to the difference between its official FTE average and its legislated FTE average teaching load standard, as can be seen in the chart for the Fall of 2012: \\n UNC System Claims Its Teaching Loads (FTE) Are Much Higher than Required \\n \\n \\n \\n Category \\n Campuses \\n Legislated Standard Courses per Semester \\n Official DE Study* Courses per Semester (2013) \\n Difference \\n \\n \\n Research I \\n NC State \\n 2.0 \\n 3.2 \\n 1.2 \\n \\n \\n \\n Chapel Hill \\n 2.0 \\n 3.0 \\n 1.0 \\n \\n \\n Research II &amp; \\n East Carolina \\n 2.5 \\n 3.6 \\n 1.1 \\n \\n \\n Doctoral \\n A&amp;T \\n 2.5 \\n 3.4 \\n 0.9 \\n \\n \\n \\n Charlotte \\n 2.5 \\n 2.9 \\n 0.4 \\n \\n \\n \\n Greensboro \\n 2.5 \\n 4.2 \\n 1.7 \\n \\n \\n Master’s \\n Appalachian \\n 3.0 \\n 3.7 \\n 0.7 \\n \\n \\n \\n Fayetteville \\n 3.0 \\n 4.0 \\n 1.0 \\n \\n \\n \\n Central \\n 3.0 \\n 4.2 \\n 1.2 \\n \\n \\n \\n Pembroke \\n 3.0 \\n 3.9 \\n 0.9 \\n \\n \\n \\n Wilmington \\n 3.0 \\n 3.7 \\n 0.7 \\n \\n \\n \\n Western \\n 3.0 \\n 3.1 \\n 0.1 \\n \\n \\n \\n Winston-Salem \\n 3.0 \\n 3.4 \\n 0.4 \\n \\n \\n Baccalaureate \\n Asheville \\n 4.0 \\n 4.3 \\n 0.3 \\n \\n \\n \\n Elizabeth City \\n 4.0 \\n 4.4 \\n 0.4 \\n \\n \\n \\n *Delaware Study \\n The chart shows that some other schools have a much greater gap between their legislated averages and their official averages than ASU’s 0.7 for 2012. Particularly questionable is UNC-Greensboro’s gap of 1.7 courses per semester for 2012. \\n Based on our review of UNC-Greensboro teaching loads, its official average of 4.2 courses per semester defies credibility. The Pope Center included two Greensboro departments in its study; for the Spring semester in 2013, the sociology department averaged 3.1 courses, while the nursing school averaged 2.2 courses. Though the Pope Center calculations are for tenure-track professors only, it is mathematically impossible for even an infinite number of part-time professors—whose average is 4.0 by definition—to raise the average above 4.0 (teaching loads don’t change drastically from one semester to the next). There are also not enough full-time non-tenured lecturers to significantly alter the numbers. Something seems very amiss. \\n Another area we explored was how teaching loads changed over the past few years. This is exceedingly important, as large cuts in state appropriations that began in the Fall of 2011 caused an outcry among UNC officials about the potential harm to the academic mission. We used the same sample of 14 departments from 7 different campuses, in a wide variety of disciplines, from the Spring of 2011 (the last semester before the cuts) and the Spring of 2013. During that period, we found no change at all in tenure-track teaching loads—for 2011 it was 2.35 and for 2013 it was 2.34. This lack of change conflicts with the UNC system’s claim that teaching loads (FTE) increased from 3.5 to 3.7 in those same years (Fall semesters). \\n Furthermore, it does not appear that there was a wholesale flight to using more adjuncts for teaching to hold down costs. In fact, the number of tenure-track faculty in the Pope Center sample increased from 298 to 320 in the two-year period. \\n With both tenure-track teaching loads and the number of tenure-track professors roughly stable, it seems that there was quite a bit of money in the UNC budget that could be cut in 2011 without affecting faculty workloads. This absence of stress on the ', 'DATA_POINT': 3.7, 'DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW': \"The text discusses the teaching loads of professors within the University of North Carolina (UNC) system, highlighting the discrepancies between reported averages and actual teaching loads. The Delaware Study reported an average of 3.7 courses taught by full-time equivalent (FTE) professors in Fall 2012, which may inflate the perceived teaching load. The methodology adjusts part-time faculty data into full-time equivalents, skewing averages. The Pope Center's review indicates discrepancies in the data, particularly at Appalachian State University, which could imply similar issues system-wide. Official reports suggest higher teaching loads than legislated requirements, raising doubts about the accuracy and integrity of the data.

In my field, in the American education system, a typical load for a tenured or tenure-track professor is 2–3; that is, five classes a year split unevenly between two semesters. If you are expected to do more research or administration, you may only have one per semester. A full time instructor or other teaching-only professor - with no administration or research compensation - is 4–4. Eight classes a year. Many adjuncts, however, get paid only about 30% the value of each class compared to their full time peers, and so often have to teach loads more like 7–9, sometimes with summer or January term classes thrown in, just to make half as much as that first professor (of the same experience and qualifications) teaching only 2–3. On the other hand, here in Rome, in the pontifical system, students take many more classes, but you spend half as much time in class and less than half as much time on reading and work as you do in the American system. A full time professor might teach 4–5 classes per semester, with 8–9 for the year being typical. Each class being roughly equivalent to half of an American class.

Adjunct professors are usually capped at three classes per term, while full-time professors at 2-year colleges will teach at least 5 courses per semester. And professors at 4-year universities will teach around 3 classes per term, depending on their rank. Someone who is a lecturer or clinician may teach five classes. But a lot of this depends on the needs of the institution and could vary each term. So, just how many classes do most university or college professors teach anyway? You might be wondering this because your professor looks burned out, or you are a professor and wonder if your course load is average compared to others. Or maybe you are just curious about how a college works. Either way, I’ve got you covered. I was a professor and can help explain all this to you and more! The difference between an adjunct professor and a full-time professor An adjunct professor is considered part-time and typically only teaches 3 courses each term while full-time professors are housed on campus and participate in college service. Adjunct professors aren’t usually guaranteed a teaching load each term, and are hired based on the current need. While full-time professors are afforded more job security and benefits. Before we even talk about how many courses a professor teaches, we have to talk about the elephant in the room. There are different types of college professors teaching on most campuses. Some are part-time and some are full-time. A full-time professor will be teaching more classes, usually, while a part-time professor is limited in their teaching load due to federal regulations and college policies. I’ll explain more about that a little later. So, adjuncts may be hired to fill the gaps at institutions because of a college’s needs or they may have some amazing experience and knowledge to bring to the students. But the university doesn’t want too many full-time professors because enrollment each semester isn’t guaranteed. Regardless, adjuncts aren’t full-time professors, usually don’t have an office and teach fewer classes than professors. A full-time professor is someone who was hired to work 40 hours a week, has an office on campus, and participates in the services of the college. They’ll usually be doing other non-teaching things like hosting events, attending meetings, planning curriculum or advising students. In a nutshell, that’s the difference between an adjunct professor and a full-time professor at most colleges. And most people ask if adjuncts are called professors. Yes, adjuncts are often called professors. Sometimes they could be called instructors or clinicians, depending on their job title and education. The difference between tenure and non-track tenure professors A non-tenure track professor will have less job security than a tenured professor. If a professor is hired in a non-track tenured position, they will have to get appraised and evaluated throughout their career to keep their job, while tenure-track professors will be on a path to have significant job security after they meet that threshold, which could take years to obtain. But once they do, they get many benefits. Most positions at a 4-year university are tenure-track while positions at 2-year community colleges are non-tenure track. Before you can learn more about the faculty teaching load of each professor, you have to understand that there are different types of institutions and professors at those colleges. At a 2-year (community college), you are going to have non-tenure track professors. A non-tenure track professor is someone who gets evaluated at regular intervals throughout their career, and doesn’t have the same job security as a tenured professor. A tenured professor gains that recognition after years of grueling research, teaching, and dedication to the university and gets to have more job security because of their status. At 4-year institutions (universities), most professors will be tenure-track professors. While they might not have tenure yet, they are on track to get tenure later. Okay, now that you understand that tenure-track professors will be on the path to more secure positions and non-tenure track positions are focused on regular appraisals and less job security, we can talk about faculty loads. How many courses does a professor teach? A professor who is at a 2-year community college will usually need to teach a minimum of 5 classes per semester. I consider a semester a 16-week term. Most professors are not required to teach during the summer. A professor who is tenure-track at a university would be expected to teach around 3 classes each semester. A professor who is non-tenure track at 4-year institutions would be expected to teach 4-5 classes per semester. Sometimes these professors might be called clinicians or lecturers. Even within 4-year universities, you will have varying levels of professors, like professor, associate professor and assistant professor. This just signifies their experience, seniority, and accomplishments. And as professors gain status and experience, they may teach fewer classes. But you can usually guarantee that a tenure-track or tenured professors will teach 2-3 classes per term. And in addition to the classes that they instruct, they typically serve as a thesis or dissertation advisor. This does result in additional work for the professor, but I wouldn’t really count it as part of their teaching load although the college might give a course release (reduce teaching load). Adjunct professors are usually limited to three classes per semester at most institutions but aren’t guaranteed to teach any courses since they are offered courses as needed. Adjuncts typically can’t teach more than 3 classes each term because they could be considered full-time based on federal employee definitions. And are even limited to the hours they can work because of retirement policies, and medical coverages. So they are almost always capped at 3, but can sometimes teach 4 short-term. Don’t forget that this is for long semesters only and professors are often teaching in the summer, winter, (break between fall and spring semesters) and even during the Maymester (break between spring and summer). These course loads will vary based on the college, but one would expect most professors to only teach 2 classes during the summer. Most won’t teach during the winter and Maymester, but if they do, they’ll likely teach only one class. And finally, keep in mind that a professor’s teaching load may change depending on if they teach graduate courses too. Or serve as a thesis or dissertation chair. They could teach fewer courses if they have other obligations. There is so much variation. Now you know that course load varies based on the institution, status of the professor, and differs for adjuncts and full-time professors. These aren’t hard rules, but seem pretty common. Course loads can vary based on the college’s needs though. So it could be different each term. How much do adjunct professors make? Adjunct professors are going to make around $3,000-$4,000 per three credit hour class. If an adjunct is teaching at a prestigious institution or has some exceptional experience, they could negotiate more. I looked at a few job openings online for adjunct professors and this seems like a pretty average salary. And from my professional experience in academia, this is totally normal for most colleges. Keep in mind that some universities may pay more based on the adjunct professor’s experience. And some colleges pay more based on their location. I have also seen additional pay for adjunct professors that have to complete lab instruction for their students too. They can often earn more. A lot of people will argue that this is entirely too little pay for the work an adjunct does and this can be true. However, a lot of adjuncts do this part-time , in addition to other full-time work. Before I started working as ', 'DATA_POINT': 3, 'DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW': \"The text provides an overview of the teaching workloads of adjunct and full-time professors at various higher education institutions.

A factor in all these concerns is the frustrating reality that, at far too many of the nation’s 2,000 four-year colleges, the work of teaching and mentoring is only a secondary concern. This has had unfortunate consequences for costs, instruction, and campus culture. It also presents an opportunity for governing boards and public officials to step up. \\n It is no coincidence that the nation’s most expensive colleges are those at which faculty teach just two to four courses per year (amounting to three or six hours a week of classroom time each semester). At these institutions, faculty devote the lion’s share of their time to research, bureaucratic duties, and chasing grants. In a burst of candor, John McGreevy, provost at Notre Dame, revealed that his institution boasts whole departments in which the faculty norm is a 1-1 teaching load (that is, teaching one three-hour class in the fall and one in the spring).[ 1 ] Indeed, McGreevy notes that teaching loads at the leading colleges have shrunk precisely because colleges compete for faculty by promising that they’ll teach less.[ 2 ] \\n The result? Colleges have resorted to relying on part-time faculty to provide the requisite teaching. Between 1999 and 2022, the 45% growth in faculty substantially outpaced the 25% increase in undergraduate enrollment.[ 3 ] At the same time, the share of full-time professors on the tenure track declined from 72% in 2002 to 62% in 2023. The number of graduate teaching assistants jumped by 40% in that same period.[ 4 ] The result is that more and more teaching is being shouldered by part-timers, adjunct faculty, and teaching assistants, who have limited opportunity or incentive to invest themselves in students’ academic lives. \\n At community colleges and many regional institutions, faculty routinely teach four or more courses each semester.[ 5 ] If colleges adopted the not-so-radical norm that faculty should devote half their working hours to instructional responsibilities, it would have massive benefits for colleges: reducing costs, alleviating the need for adjunct faculty, and increasing faculty–student interaction. \\n So why don’t we talk more about faculty workload, given the familiar concerns about college costs, the student experience, and the “adjunctification” of higher education? For starters, higher-education research organizations seem disinclined to release data on faculty work time to the public. \\n \\n How Much Do Professors Actually Teach? Shhh … It’s a Secret \\n \\n Ohio University economist Richard Vedder noted: “One of the closest guarded secrets in American higher education is the average teaching loads of faculty.”[ 6 ] Vedder wasn’t wrong. Since 1996, for instance, the University of Delaware has administered the annual National Study of Instructional Costs and Productivity, surveying faculty and teaching assistants about course loads and enrollment. The data, though, are “only available to four-year, non-profit institutions of higher education.”[ 7 ] This secrecy, needless to say, is not the norm for surveys collected by publicly supported institutions. Tellingly, this study is being discontinued because the number of participating institutions “has slowly declined to unsustainable levels.”[ 8 ] \\n The U.S. Department of Education used to track faculty workloads through the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF), administering it in 1987–88, 1992–93, 1998–99, and 2003–04. The survey asked professors about their teaching loads, instructional time, use of teaching assistants, and scholarly activity. After 2004, the National Center for Education Statistics stopped collecting these data.[ 9 ] The Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) has collected data on faculty teaching regularly since 1989. However, only the data collected prior to 1999 are publicly available.[ 10 ] A request for more recent data requires a multipage proposal with a theoretical framework, a fee, and a description of how any results will be shared.[ 11 ] \\n The Center for Postsecondary Research at Indiana University has administered the Faculty Survey of Student Engagement (FSSE) since 2003.[ 12 ] While the center does not publish full results or information on individual institutions, it does publish some data visualizations with aggregated information on faculty teaching load and time use. (Detailed institutional data are shared privately, only with participating institutions.)[ 13 ] \\n We searched a dozen organizations (including the Association for the Study of Higher Education and the Institute for Higher Education Policy) for the terms “faculty teaching loads,”“college course load,” “teaching load,” “professor course load,” “professor schedule,” and “faculty load.” In 10 of 12 instances, the searches returned zero results.[ 14 ] \\n Clearly, there is a shortage of concrete, reliable data on teaching in higher education. Even the information that does get collected is not publicly disseminated. \\n \\n Teaching Is Not the Priority \\n \\n Across a large swath of academe, teaching is perceived as a burden to be endured. Faculty bemoan heavy teaching loads. Prized faculty teach light loads, with courses “bought out” by research grants or fellowships. (Deans and department chairs similarly negotiate for reduced teaching loads.) In short, a lighter teaching load is a badge of professional success. \\n University of Pennsylvania education professor Jonathan Zimmerman notes that faculty tend to characterize “research as their ‘work’ and teaching as their ‘load,’ ” a habit that, as Zimmerman dryly observes, says “volumes about academic priorities.”[ 15 ] University of Michigan political scientist Edie Goldenberg and her coauthor, the late John Cross, note that much undergraduate instruction has been farmed out to non-tenure-track staff so that tenured faculty can focus on research, grants, and administration.[ 16 ] \\n Vedder has observed that at schools with large numbers of graduate students, faculty “turn much of the critically important teaching of beginning undergraduates over to inexperienced graduate students.”[ 17 ] He elaborates that at top research universities, it is “not uncommon for professors to teach but one course, usually for three hours a week. A load of two courses per semester (six hours in the classroom) would be considered fairly heavy.”[ 18 ] Naomi Schaefer Riley has noted that “to do the real work of teaching...colleges have ‘adjunctified’ themselves, using part-time faculty, graduate students, and others hired on a semester-to-semester basis.”[ 19 ] \\n A few studies have examined how instructors spend their time. One survey of scientists and engineers at 150 research institutions found that tenured faculty reported spending about one-third of their time on teaching-related activities.[ 20 ] Another study found that tenure-track faculty reported spending 27%–35% of their working hours on instructional tasks.[ 21 ] In 2021, two assistant professors in the humanities penned a piece detailing their work routines: they reported devoting slightly less than 16 hours a week to teaching; 8 hours weekly to campus “service” (including campus programs and academic journals); and another 5–10 hours weekly to administrative tasks like email, trainings, and professional development.[ 22 ] \\n \\n The Competition to Teach Less \\n \\n In 2019, John McGreevy, fresh off a 10-year term as dean of Notre Dame’s College of Arts and Letters, described a destructive “arms race” in teaching. He asked: “How many courses per semester should a faculty member at a major research university teach?” and continued: \\n \\n The question is rarely asked—because it’s in no one’s interest to ask it. Not presidents, since in public institutions they, unlike faculty members, have to answer questions from more or less curious and inform', 'DATA_POINT': 2, 'DATA_SOURCE_OVERVIEW': 'The text discusses concerns about the low prioritization of teaching in higher education institutions, where faculty often have light teaching loads of only two to four courses per year due to the emphasis on research and administrative duties. This has resulted in increased reliance on part-time faculty and teaching assistants, potentially affecting the quality and costs of education. The scarcity of public data on faculty teaching loads is highlighted as a major issue, with specific studies and surveys mentioned as sources of limited information.', 'component': 'Average number of classes per professor'}, {'DATA_SOURCE_NAME': 'How many class room hours does the typical university teacher ...', 'DATA_SOURCE_LINK': 'https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/7450/how-many-class-room-hours-does-the-typical-university-teacher-teach-per-week', 'DATA_SOURCE_TEXT': 'I am wondering, for full time university teachers (not those who also have research responsibilities), what is generally the number of hours per week that they teach? I currently teach 20 hours per week and find the load quite heavy giving me little time to prep new modules with quality. Adding to that the responsibility of marking and it is not uncommon that I end up working more like 50-60 hours per week to teach 20. \\n Are these numbers average? High?

Let\\'s take a few examples: \\n \\n UK, lecturer: it\\'s usually a full-time position, so you have to put in 35-40 hours per week. The ratio of lecture time over all the rest (preparation, departmental committees, etc.) depends on the contract, but I have rarely seen it pushed past 1:1 (which means roughly 20 hours of teaching, maybe 25 at most). \\n France, \"PRAG\": this is the position of a high-School teacher detached to a university, and the closest one to a lecturer position. Their nominal teaching load is 384 hours per year, with a weight of 1.5 for lectures and 1 for exercises sessions. But for one the year is very short, from about 23 to 26 weeks, so that means about 15 hours per week, and this is only the nominal amount. In any cases, they (voluntarily or not) have to teach additional hours, which are paid in addition (to a lower rate than nominal hours). \\n As a point of comparison: a French high-school teacher would have 18 teaching hours per week. \\n \\n Other comparison points, less relevant to the question as they are for teaching+research positions: \\n \\n France, associate professor ( maître de conférences ): junior-level position, supposed to be half teaching and half research. This has a fixed number of 192 teaching hours per year . If you consider that those are spread on 30 weeks, it gives 6.4 hours per week . Even considering it is not a teaching-only position, that number is lower than the one you quote. \\n France, full professor ( professeur des universités ): same number of hours in theory, but as you gain seniority you can do more full-class teaching (with bigger groups), of which every hour counts as 1.5 hour in your yearly total. Through this, and other mechanisms, senior professors usually have fewer hours to teach. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n answered Jan 25, 2013 at 9:19 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n F\\'x F\\'x 74.7k 24 gold badges 269 silver badges 396 bronze badges \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 20 hours per week for most teaching only positions is normal. I have seen Profs with major research responsibilities that at times have had 20 hours of teaching as well. \\n My rule of thumb for a course: You will spend 2 to 3 times the amount of teaching you do preparing the first time you teach a course and this decreases as years go on for that same course (a new course requires considerable amount of time for preparation again). \\n First time I was teaching advanced thermodynamics and fluid mechanics courses I was spending two full days per 2 hours of teaching actually! but then after three years it was down to preparing 2 hours for 2 hours of teaching. \\n Your numbers seem right to me. In short 20 hours of teaching = virtually no time to do research. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n answered Jan 25, 2013 at 3:24 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n blackace blackace 3,571 1 gold badge 26 silver badges 37 bronze badges \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 3 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n I assume you are talking about in term time teaching per week and not total teaching per year/52. I have never heard of a permanent full time position having a heavier teaching load than a 5-5. Some people then choose to teach summer courses (but this wouldn\\'t effect you teaching hours per term week). Often this type of load includes some repetition so you might only have to prep 7 courses of which only 1 might be a new prep. The amount of classroom contact time for each course might be as low as 3 hours but could climb to 6. There might also be some office hour contact (which you might count as teaching contact). Many full time teaching jobs have lighter loads and can be as low as 3-3. Research intensive departments can have typical teaching loads as low as 1-1. Adjuncts often teach as high as 6-6 in order to make ends meet. \\n There is so much more than just the number of taught hours that influence teaching load. I think you need to look at number of classroom hours, number of unique preps, office hours, and marking. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n answered Jan 25, 2013 at 11:11 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n StrongBad StrongBad 106k 30 gold badges 271 silver badges 490 bronze badges \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n It depends on the type of institution. at my university, a post 1992 UK university in Newcastle, myself and some other colleagues teach on average 14 hours a week! yes and you have to research and engage in administration, including marking (lots of it) meeting students, supervising both under and post graduate students. I have broken down finally. it was too much to bear and I am currently on sick leave. Hopefully, my hours of teaching will be reduced after this incident. \\n In pre 1992 universities, I understand the typical teaching load is 6 hours a week. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n answered Nov 21, 2016 at 14:37 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Depends to different parameters, but university generally expects each academic staff works \\n \\n 40% research \\n 40% teaching \\n 20% involvement in committees and university meetings \\n \\n Of course, different personalities have different interests to focus on either of research or teaching activities. That\\'s why, some take more courses than others. \\n In addition to personal interests, needs of school is another issue. For instance imagine one of the lecturers needs to stay at hospital after injury in accident. Head of school asks one of the academic staff to cover his/her absent colleague. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n answered Jan 25, 2013 at 3:52 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n antmw1361 antmw1361 1,203 10 silver badges 22 bronze badges \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n In the US teaching load is assigned in terms of courses or credit hours per year and varies heavily between \"teaching schools\" and research schools. For example, I currently teach undergraduates at a teaching school (i.e., it does virtually no research, but has the name university attached like most institutions) that has a load of 30 credit hours per year, and am moving to another teaching school that has a load of 33 credit hours per year. \\n At a research school nearby I know lecturers (no research) teach 3-3 (3 courses in the fall semester, 3 courses in the spring semester, and mostly 4 credit courses). Professors (researcher and teaching load) at the same school taught 2-2 (2 courses in fall, and 2 in spring). \\n A credit hour is approximately 15 lecture hours over the course of a semester, so these loads vary from 33*15= 495 teaching hours per year ( 9.5 hours / week on a 52-week year ), to 6*4*15 = 360 hours per year ( 6.9 hours / week on a 52-week year ). For this spring semester I am currently teaching 11 hours of lecture per week and an additional 4 hours of lab sessions per week. My load is usually lighter in the summers, but not by that much. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n answered Apr 28, 2014 at 14:21 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Paul Paul 121 4 bronze badges \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 2 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n In my university in Australia, my 60% time is teaching which translates into 360 hours for one year so about 10 hours per week.
